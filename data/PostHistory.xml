Please don’t think that it’s necessary to use a domain name that reflects something going wrong. We picked the name “Stack Overflow” because it has some meaning for real programmers, not because it reflected a bug or problem. “Super User” is just as good a name. I get depressed by all these suggestions of “BurntChicken.com”, “LostYarmulke.com”, and “FallenArches.com” (for former owners of McDonald’s franchises, of course).&#xD;&#xA;   2. Look for jargon that has meaning to the group of people you want to attract. Insider jargon is the duck call of insiders. Look at me! If I can say “contributory negligence,” I must be a real lawyer!&#xD;&#xA;   3. .coms are a million times better than other TLDs.&#xD;&#xA;   4. A domain name should be readable over the phone. Even on AT&amp;T Wireless. Tricky spellings are always a bad idea. Similarly, dashes reek of desperation.&#xD;&#xA;   5. Long names are not the end of the world.

Squatted and taken names,&#xD;&#xA;   however clever, are not helpful. You&#xD;&#xA;   can use [whois.net](http://www.whois.net/) to check&#xD;&#xA;   availability.&#xD;&#xA; - Post one domain per answer. This&#xD;&#xA;   makes the voting process much easier.&#xD;&#xA;   If domains are very similar (e.g.&#xD;&#xA;   &quot;game&quot; and &quot;games&quot;), they can be in&#xD;&#xA;   the same answer.&#xD;&#xA; - Make sure the domain wasn't already&#xD;&#xA;   suggested. To search within this&#xD;&#xA;   question, use a search query such as:&#xD;&#xA;   inquestion:1 &quot;example.com&quot; replacing&#xD;&#xA;   example.com with the domain to search&#xD;&#xA;   for&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From &quot;[Stack Exchange FAQ: Domain Names][1]&quot;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   1. Please don’t think that it’s necessary to use a domain name that reflects something going wrong. We picked the name “Stack Overflow” because it has some meaning for real programmers, not because it reflected a bug or problem. “Super User” is just as good a name. I get depressed by all these suggestions of “BurntChicken.com”, “LostYarmulke.com”, and “FallenArches.com” (for former owners of McDonald’s franchises, of course).&#xD;&#xA;   2. Look for jargon that has meaning to the group of people you want to attract. Insider jargon is the duck call of insiders. Look at me! If I can say “contributory negligence,” I must be a real lawyer!&#xD;&#xA;   3. .coms are a million times better than other TLDs.&#xD;&#xA;   4. A domain name should be readable over the phone. Even on AT&amp;T Wireless. Tricky spellings are always a bad idea. Similarly, dashes reek of desperation.&#xD;&#xA;   5. Long names are not the end of the world. Using two or three words (or a couple of digits) is a good way to find available domains.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Or see section 4 on [our own meta FAQ][2].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's try to brainstorm for some concise, bicycle-related and easily identifiable jargon per Domain Name FAQ #2. If we use a word (or words) unique to bicycling, we'll more likely be able to secure a .com domain name without paying a fortune.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarly, we should avoid very common terminology (Bike/Cycle/Cyclist/Bicycle) and terminology not specific to bicycling (Rider/Wheel/Velocity/Tire/Chain).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, when posting a new suggestion, please use this format:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    **FooBar.com** - ([Not Registered][1])&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;      [1]: http://www.whois.net/whois/foobar.com&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/domain-names/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 2.5" />

It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or an experienced cyclist, you are most certainly welcome.

This site is a free Q &amp; A site, and we're aiming to cover cycling in all forms. It's free to ask questions, free to answer questions, and free to read. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The site is run by us, the community. It is collaboratively built and maintained by fellow bicycling enthusiasts. Once the system learns to trust you, you'll be able to edit anything, much like Wikipedia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This isn't a site to discuss things, this is a site where you can ask questions that have (ideally) a single answer, or at least a single best answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our goal is to become the go-to internet location for expert answers to objective questions. This requirement that questions be objective helps maintain the quality and expert appeal of our site. You won't ever have to dig through tons of questions like &quot;what bike should I get ...&quot; that are better suited for the discussion format of boards like this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few examples of the questions that have been asked and answered on our site:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- What considerations are important when purchasing a new chain?&#xD;&#xA;- Are there any recumbent tricycles that can be transported with a normal car?&#xD;&#xA;- What can I do to keep my rear dérailleur in good condition when commuting in the snow?&#xD;&#xA;- How do I prevent disk brakes from squeaking in the rain?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please stop by and check us out. It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or an experienced cyclist, you are most certainly welcome. We want the community to expand!

Don't leave a comment asking the author to do it; many won't understand, some won't be able, all will be annoyed, and already-submitted rep-farming answers will remain in non-wiki mode.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Determine the most applicable close reason for the question. If the question can be made more objective / less localized / more coherent / etc. (whatever would prevent it from being closed), without altering the question's meaning, then edit it. Stop.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Assuming the question can't be edited due to insufficient detail (which is the case for at least 90% of closed subjective questions) then it goes down one of the following two tracks:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. Leave a comment warning that the question as written is likely to be closed.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. Suggest how the author could improve the question.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. If the author fails to respond within a reasonable time (i.e. a few hours), actually vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The other strategy, which is the one [they] prefer, is:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. Immediately vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. Leave a comment explaining (politely!) why you voted to close.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. Suggest how the author could improve the question, or appeal the decision on meta.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. Return to the question several hours later, and if it has been closed and also edited (improved), then vote to reopen it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This would mean the pro-tem moderators would need to step in for the (flagged) subjective questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;dagger; I don't mean to pick on the poster of that question specifically, it's just a recent example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/693/should-we-lean-more-heavily-to-editing-questions-vs-closing-them/701#701&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/693/should-we-lean-more-heavily-to-editing-questions-vs-closing-them&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/949/hard-data-on-price-vs-weight-closed&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://meta.cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/693/should-we-lean-more-heavily-to-editing-questions-vs-closing-them/701#701" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 2.5" />

Well, it’s simple. 15 to 20 times per week we provide tips that will save you money, increase your productivity, or simply keep you sane. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Think about how your elevator pitch works with the rest of the site. Can it be used as a tagline? Or will you need a shorter version for a t-shirt, bumper sticker, and other marketing material? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Do you need a shortened tagline? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Find a tagline&amp;thinsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;thinsp;a motto&amp;thinsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;thinsp;that works well with your elevator pitch. If it's short enough, the tagline and elevator pitch can be the same thing. Great Examples: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/): News for nerds. Stuff that matters. &#xD;&#xA;- [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/): Don’t live to geek, geek to live! &#xD;&#xA;- [The Simple Dollar](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/): Financial talk for the rest of us. &#xD;&#xA;- [Needcoffee.com](http://www.needcoffee.com/): We are the Internet equivalent of a triple espresso with whipped cream.

We should *accept that traffic's likely to be lower* until March. The majority of cyclists are fair-weather cyclists who probably don't even think about their bike through winter.&#xD;&#xA;2. We seem to have a core of people that visit the site every day or two and answer questions when they come in.  We're doing well.  I hope that this core of people continues to visit regularly through winter.&#xD;&#xA;3. We're doing well at answering questions.  There is a [single solitary unanswered question][2] on our site right now, our answer numbers round to 100% answered.  *Questions are getting answered.*&#xD;&#xA;4. There will be questions from winter cyclists, questions about related activities (winter training, winter storage, etc), questions from people that find winter a good time to rebuild their bicycles, and questions from the southern hemisphere (Australia especially).  Fewer overall, but still some.&#xD;&#xA;5. The 90 day beta evaluation time period is in 2 days.  Don't worry about it: I think we're doing well on providing solid timely answers to questions, and I think the SE team can understand that a site about cycling will have some seasonality to it and give us a few more months.  (I'd suggest we ask for pushing the final evaluation off until mid-April if the question comes up)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think what we should concentrate on is making the site work well, and prepare ourselves for increased traffic come spring:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **Vote**. Vote good answers and good questions up.  For bad ones maybe comment to give the poster a chance to improve, but vote them down when they're bad (you can always change your vote if the post changes).  The site works on an economy of reputation points that are earned through votes on good questions and answers.  The more people writing good answers get reputation points, the more there's people that can help run the site, which will be important when there's more traffic come spring, and especially important when we get out of beta.&#xD;&#xA;2. If a question can be improved, suggest or edit. (but make sure the spirit of the question is kept intact; be very careful with edits on questions)&#xD;&#xA;3. Continue answering the questions that do come in.  The better quality the answers the better off we are.&#xD;&#xA;4. If you can answer a question better, do it.  If there's several answers that could be combined into one perfect answer, give credit (with a link) to the quoted bits and write your own better answer.  If the answers are decent but you can do some research and improve on them: do it.&#xD;&#xA;5. If you have a question related to cycling, ask it on bicycles.SE.  There's some questions that make me think the questioner isn't genuinely interested in getting an answer, and in my opinion those don't tend to be as useful, since they're less likely to match up with the words in a google search for somebody with a question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some attempts at promotion to Australia, winter cycling sites, etc wouldn't hurt, though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/199/interest-over-winter/201#201&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/unanswered" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 2.5" />

It may be specific enough that nobody but the original questioner will ever find the answer useful. A year or two from now the answer will be wrong because the manufacturer stops making that model (or that particular shop drops it).  It's basically a shopping answer that might be better answered with links to the websites of tire manufacturers that make tires with a stripe of color.

Something a little more general like &quot;part X in different color choices&quot; would be a bit better, especially if it led to answers with multiple choices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It always depends on the specifics, but I would think that a question like &quot;I have X derailer, will Y shifters work&quot; would be a good question that I'd want to see left open. The ideal answer wouldn't be &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; or &quot;if you add Z part&quot;, it would tell how to tell what shifter would work with that type of derailer.  Even better would be to change the question to that slightly more general case: &quot;I have X derailer, how do I tell what shifter will work with it?&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm inclined to try to steer away from too much straight out product recommendations.  If product recommendations have to happen I'd prefer to see a selection instead of a single one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I love the idea of questions about how to build a bike, though.  And I get that there's details where some specific product recommendations are hard to avoid.  The questions that are about trying to learn instead of what the best part is are going to be much better, though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Coincidentally, there was a recent post on the Stackoverflow blog about this kind of question:&#xD;&#xA;[Q&amp;A is Hard, Let's Go Shopping!](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, I think some of the issues with the shopping type questions aren't as applicable to bicycles because the technology isn't changing as fast as computers and electronics.  However, specific product recommendations are still unlikely to be useful for more than a couple years, since all the bikes and parts seem to change every year or two (even if just to nearly equivalent new model).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do think there can be a bit more value to some bicycle product recommendations than, say, electronics product recommendations: there are bike parts under $50 (such as tires) that can make a huge difference and are very hard to find any kind of reviews or details, even who makes parts like what you're looking for.  Most of the reviewing seems to go to the big ticket items." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 2.5" />

Here is a very brief summary of the discussion: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - There are many people visiting the site but people are losing interest because there are not enough questions to answer.  &#xD;&#xA; - The low hanging fruit is being picked.  Soon there will not be an extremely large amount of questions to ask.  This is different that SO since the biking technology is changing much more slowly and I think in general because questions are less complex.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that the main problem with allowing regional questions is they are usually not relevant to users from different regions.  To solve this we need some form of filtering mechanism.  Ideally having some built in method would be great but in the meantime I think we should just start using tags.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that all regional questions should be tagged with: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - tag: `regional`&#xD;&#xA; - tag: `&lt;Country&gt;` ie: `Canada`&#xD;&#xA; - tag: `&lt;Provence/State&gt;` ie: `Ontario`&#xD;&#xA; - tag: `&lt;Closest Major City&gt;` ie: `Ottawa`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some questions may not require all tags.  For example: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - *&quot;Where can I order used bike parts online in Canada?&quot;* - would only require the `regional` and `Canada` tag&#xD;&#xA; - *&quot;What is a best two day trail to do within 6 hours Ottawa?&quot;* - would require the `regional` tag, the `Canada` tag, the `Ontario` tag, and the `Quebec` tag.  (Ottawa is on the border of Quebec and Ontario so both provence tags would apply).  &#xD;&#xA; - &quot;Where can I find a 27 inch tube in Halifax?&quot; would be tagged: `regional`,`Halifax`, `Nova Scotia`, `Canada`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The logic about what questions to show users seems pretty simple too.  Seems to me: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    if(regionalTag)&#xD;&#xA;        if(userDisplayAllRegions)&#xD;&#xA;            display question in list; &#xD;&#xA;        else&#xD;&#xA;            if(countryTag == usersCountryTag)&#xD;&#xA;                if(provenceTag == usersProvenceTag)&#xD;&#xA;                    if(cityTag == usersCityTag)&#xD;&#xA;                       display question in list; &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But maybe we are not allowed to touch the code.  Regardless I think we should start allowing regional questions and start tagging them.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/184/future-questions-future-answers&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 2.5" />

The question is quite vague. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For contrast, here are some more specific questions, that might actually be useful to someone:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;how can I set up my road bike so I can safely ride it down a steep dirt path?&quot; (since I want to spontaneously ride somewhere that looks fun)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;how can I set up my mountain bike to be more efficient on the road&quot; (since I ride on the road to get to my favorite off-road area)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;how can I set up a bike to work equally well for up-hill and down-hill off-road?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;How can I set up my bike to be as fast as possible on my commute to work?&quot; (because I'm a speed demon and my only chance to ride is while commuting)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2285/is-there-a-all-in-one-bike" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 2.5" />

But by asking it you find out more about the trade-offs and can make your next bike selection more easily.

If there's new information that invalidates an answer or makes for a better answer, please update.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If there's an existing answer that's close, you may instead want to instead comment on that answer, or if you see an &quot;edit&quot; link on the answer, edit the post to improve it.

They don't care about the general, only the specific problem they're actually having and looking for a solution to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A question that's so specific that nobody else will ever have a similar problem and be helped by the answers to your question is probably too localized. But questions that super-specific are quite rare.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A specific question about that one bike right in front of you that could be similar to problems with other bikes is fine.  I'd expect this to be the most typical question we'll get, in fact.  The questioner includes the model of bike and the model of component and pictures of their actual bike and the answers help them solve their very specific problem, but somebody later with a similar problem on a similar bike with a similar component might see that question and answers and find their solution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A general question with answers that would generalize to answer many specific questions is good, but hard to do. Generalizing a question often means leaving out important specific details. Details make questions easier to answer. Details make questions more easily found. Details make the question and answers more useful. Details may mean that you don't need to ask a followup question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A question and answers that are carefully written to generally and definitively answer all similar questions of that type for all time are a beautiful ideal, but they're like unicorns: they don't really exist.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we get similar (related) specific questions, they should have the same tags, which will get the other questions linked in the &quot;Related&quot; area on the right side of the question page.

When people return to cycling in March and take their bikes out of mothballs (carbon-fiber mothballs, of course), they'll come looking for answers to questions and see a community that's been keeping the flame going and is ready to answer further questions.

It is hard to understand the term *professional* if you are hindered to speak about *value* products i.e. *low-cost and risky*. So what is SO's stance about *discrimination*?

You talk about what inspired your question. You talk about images you saw. You talk about the history of why you're asking the question.

It takes a while to realize that the images you saw are actually the types of things you want from a kickstand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A lot of your questions have this kind of problem where a potential answerer will have to spend too much time figuring out what you're actually trying to ask.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't give us your life story; don't give irrelevant details (like who inspired you to ask); don't introduce the question with a convoluted preamble; don't try to ask in a way that will solve the problem for everybody else.

Maybe include a few specific product recommendations with the reasons for them related to the general reasons. Even bad questions are likely to be left open if they have an awesome answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Notice on that shopping question that the upvoted answers are the ones that tell you how to find a jacket or are specific about why a given choice is good, and that the actual straight product recommendations never got any votes...

On Android and Apple and Webapps, it’s app-rec. On Programmers and Stack Overflow, it’s lang-rec and framework-rec. On Photography it’s cam-rec. Those questions swamp the site and add basically NO value because the amount to 100% unverifiable opinion.

The knee is a complex joint and there are quite a few causes of knee pain. And also, various solutions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the simplest, a cyclist may merely need to adjust the seat or cleat position. This sort of thing is probably ok for a &quot;Cycling Knee Pain&quot; wiki.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, knee pain can be difficult to figure out. The pain can be anterior, posterior, lateral, or medial. And, the type of knee pain will vary as well. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anecdotally, an acquaintance was suffering lateral knee pain. He diagnosed himself on a web forum with ITBS. And treated himself for that. It got worse, and it turns out, he had a lateral meniscus tear...and ultimately needed surgery.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A knee pain wiki could be possible with some strong caveats. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Will it keep the question fro getting closed, or help it get re-opened?  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stack Exchange text is both creative-commons licensed and the site is a wiki, so users with sufficient rep can edit whatever they feel will help the site, making whatever changes are needed. They'll understand, of course. And hey, they can always revert, yes? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Uh, no. It's not that simple, unless you want to alienate people. I'd be a little peeved is someone significantly changed what I was saying. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes, the reason a question is becoming much removed from the original question is that the &quot;editor&quot; has a lot of stuff to say on the topic. Or... is the problem that the original question had too *little* to say, or that you have too *much* to say? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm an editor for a living, and I have to keep in mind that *this is not my work*, and that *these are not my words*. I'm trying to help the author say what they want to say, but make the novel *better*. If I cant do that when I get sample chapters, maybe that means the original text is unsalvageable and I shouldn't accept the project. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarly: If the question starts becoming more your own question, perhaps it'd be best to vote to close (or leave it closed) and simply write your own question on the subject. We can have multiple varieties of the same question open, as long as they are clearly different. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If things are uncertain, we can leave a question closed until we figure out what to do with it. &quot;Closed&quot; is, I think, an unfortunate term. What it really means is that a question can;t be answered. &quot;Frozen&quot; might be a better term, but I think we're stuck with things as they are for now. We can close a question, discuss it here, make it better (with the buy-in of the original author), then re-open. Or we may decide it's best to leave it closed and try again. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Summary**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, I think there's a point where one is editing too much. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fortunately, people with the reputation scores to edit should also have the good judgement to either know where that line is, or to use all their resources to find it--i.e., to ask for help or community consensus.

There are multiple answers, and different answers might work in seemingly identical situations. The people who are looking for help on this issue are also likely to try multiple answers, and to read as many answers as it takes to get what they want. So if we end up with 20 different answers that's actually a good thing. Also, different people will know of difference resources that are broadly similar and it would be better if they were added to one answer rather than scattered through multiple equivalent answers (I'm sure my bike bus suggestion has parallels in other countries, although here BikeSaint stole it from the &quot;walking bus&quot; community).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm cautious because of the herd voting effect, where the answers at the top of the rankings attract disproportionately more votes over time, making later answers unlikely to ever get more than a few votes. But then, we will probably only get 10 answers, not the hundreds for &quot;what's a good SF book&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's also the likelihood of drift into &quot;what makes populations more likely to cycle&quot;, because that clearly affects each individual in the population.

Are you considering a suspension fork? Are you undecided between a carbon or an aluminum frame? What about disc wheels on road bikes? What kinds of brakes should you look for? And so on. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- You asked about how a bike will age: That might be a question all on its own. &quot;How can I determine how well a bike will stand up over the years?&quot;, perhaps. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Certain models seem to be compared to other models with regularity, for example, the Trek 520 and the Surly LHT are often held up to each other. The Bike Friday Tikit and the Brompton are often similarly compared. (Et cetera.) Asking questions about the advantages and disadvantages of bikes that inevitably get compared sounds great, as long as the question focuses on the &quot;why&quot;. (The 520 is easier to get ahold of to test-ride, the LHT is easier to configure; the Brommie folds smaller, but the Tikit can carry more cargo.) However, keep in mind that these bikes change a bit every year. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary, I'd save &quot;Which bike should I buy&quot; questions for the forums. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you would prefer, you could always post draft questions to Meta first if you want people to help you refine them a bit before posting on the main site, or even ask about it in chat.

In fact this advice should be better than that because of the variety of opinion, short-cuts and tips that only come with experience, all distilled with the voting system into quality answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is also no financial reason to give answers that 'cost more money', e.g. on a recent question on straightening out handlebars, in a retail environment you would sell the customer the bars, fresh tape and go for the novelty bell, hopefully to get a good chunk of the customer's wallet, leaving them with a big job putting their bars back together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, on SE you can say 'get a big bit of wood and try straightening them out' - potentially a five minute task with no money changing hands. To suggest this in a retail setting to a customer is potentially a sackable offence as saving customers money is morally wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given the above example, I see Bicycles.SE as hopefully becoming the de-facto place on the web to learn everything and anything about how to fix/repair a bike, a 'virtual mechanic's brain' where the 'virtual mechanic' has wisdom of the crowds and is never too busy to help out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*As for the blog idea...*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I dislike the existing bike sites that 'cater' for cyclists. In the UK I particularly dislike the 'BikeRadar' effort of 'History Publishing' - it smells of car-driving-out-of-preference-types that just ended up in dead-tree publishing and their attempt at trying to put something together that might catch the cycling crowd. It has no soul, it talks down and second-guesses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have little or no interest in the 'pro' cycling websites (outside of the three weeks of July Tour de France when I read all the gossip I can get). Given how many pro websites there are I think this segment is catered for adequately.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mountain biking specific websites/magazines/blogs get my goat a bit. I see the whole MTB craze of the 90's as a reaction to the motor-mania of the last century, although great fun, going off-road is admitting defeat on using bikes for regular transport. We don't have to do that now, we don't have bikes 'just for fun', they are transport not-just for children and people who got nicked drink-driving.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The sites I *do* like are things like the cycle-porn-in-Copenhagen stuff, the reviews of cafes-by-bike website and *that sort of stuff*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I would like to see in a SE blog is coupled to what SE is primarily going to be about, which is Q+A, which is 'virtual mechanic'. I may have misunderstood this 'mission', however, it is compatible with what a lot of other cycling orgs are trying to do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The people doing outreach, the people into tours, the people into culture and products, all of them could do with some add-on reference for the 'how do I do this' questions. Venerable organisations such as the UK's Cyclists Touring Club (CTC) should give up on their own forums and CMS and direct the questions to Bicycles.SE, just because it is the superior platform for that kind of stuff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*So anyway...*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would like to see the blog be put together with contributors from outside Bicycles.SE, for example, Louise from http://www.patisseriecyclisme.co.uk/ *could* write something fantastic, not really to plug her site but to nonetheless get more traffic. Next week we could invite someone else to put together a guest post, the Copenhagen Cycling Chic -guy.&#xD;&#xA;Again, a thinking-persons essay without any of the commercialism, patronising 'you-must-wear-helmet-obey-motorist' attitude, 'I ride bike style road/fixie/DH MTB/my-tri-bars-are-bigger-than-yours' snobbery.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Invites to guest write for the Bicycles.SE blog should be a core part of the blog start, however, I think we need to be able to summarize our mission so that people see what we are trying to do and are therefore keen to write quality articles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The blog could also be a place for nurturing quality writing talent. I know some people can write their journey to work as an epic tale of struggle against adversity with beginning, middle and end. I also know some people that can go all the way around the world and have nothing to say about it. So the subject is sometimes secondary to a good read.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The blog can also be a place where questions that were particularly well responded to get re-posted, to not get buried. The 'editors picks' as it were.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for bike reviews, I think these could be really good if people are talking about the pride and joy they just bought, as opposed to salesman speak or depressed-journalist-speak.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rarely are blogs made from lots of guest posts, nobody even thinks about guest blogging for somewhere. It would be good to have something that bucked that trend.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*To conclude*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's decide what our niche is, who we are going to reach and how it is going to relate to the Q+A site.&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Here are my thoughts on the second point. TLDR: It could go either way, I think a wiki would be slightly less useful than individual questions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A community wiki about repair procedures *could* work. In order to be continually useful, though, it would have to be something that is useful as a reference as well as something that wouldn't work as individual questions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For examples, let's go with the terminology index. It's useful because (1) there's good information there, and (2) most of these entries wouldn't be good questions on their own, or at least would have to be expanded quite a bit. In the wiki, we can put down a brief entry, enough to at least get someone started on understanding the term in question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Would a similar index of repair procedures structured like the terminology index work? Well, it might. They'd have to be brief, and would often tend to get larger and more detailed over time. If you're just talking about a list of procedures and the estimated times to perform them, that would be useful and fit well into a wiki. However, people would naturally add more information over time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More detailed overviews of complex jobs like &quot;How do I repack my bearings&quot; or &quot;How do I size a replacement stem&quot; would probably work better as questions on their own, perhaps questions tagged with something like [repar-job-overview]. We'd get several different takes on each one, the best ones would be voted to the top, and--most importantly in my view--people would get rewarded with reputation when they're upvoted, so there's more incentive to provide good answers. We have a lot of wrenchers on this site. I'm sure that these questions would get good answers! Maybe we could even find a way to use the blog for this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bottom line, if you decide the site would be best off with a repair procedure community wiki, go for it. (I'll be happy to mark it CW for you, since you need a mod to do it.)

Each site will have its own unique theme that will reflect its topic. However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;During the brainstorming phase, I asked myself, why do people ride bicycles if they have a choice of driving a car, or why do they choose cycling if there are other forms of exercise? &#xD;&#xA;As a one-time bicycle lover myself, I thought about personal freedom, accessibility, low cost and being in touch with the great outdoors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So for the design, I wanted to capture the feeling of riding a bike, rather than focusing on the bike as an object. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Riding a bicycle is a very personal and independent choice. I wanted the design to reflect that. I believe a hand illustrated art style gives it a more personal touch, and the slightly vintage treatment makes it more timeless. After all, bicycles have been around for a long time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since the design is entirely focused on a &quot;feeling,&quot; I decided to design a poster for our bicycles site first. That way, I didn't have the distraction of the constraints I normally face when creating a design for the web.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Rycp.jpg&quot;&gt;![Bicycles Poster][2]&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;(click for larger version)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Above is the poster I came up with. I believe the texture, color scheme and minimalist style work towards the goal I was aiming for. From there I transfered the visual elements onto the site design.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/06pZZ.jpg&quot;&gt;![Homepage Design][3]&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/IpEPg.jpg&quot;&gt;![Question Page Design][4]&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;(click for full res version)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please keep in mind, not all of the site elements are present in these two mockups. I incorporated some visuals related to bicycles and cycling, e.g. road signs and cogs. But I was careful to not to make it overly &quot;themey.&quot; Also, I tried to fit all of the design in one image, so it looks busier than the live site will be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm pleased with the overall design. It did capture the feel I was going after. The site has a unique identity, while maintaining the feeling of the Stack Exchange family. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd love to hear your feedback.

Anything that sounds otherwise is really really minor details. If we go live with this design exactly like this I'd be happy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like the logo, it basically says &quot;I love bikes&quot; to me, which is a sentiment I can go for. I won't be surprised if some people don't like a heart as a logo.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The whole design is a wee bit whimsical, which I like and some won't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think maybe you were thinking of a sort of &quot;vintage&quot; thing with the texture, but it also reminds me of a road surface, which is a nice touch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the most part your design is about riding the bike, while most of our questions are about the mechanics of the bike.  The design looks more like riding on a day off than any kind of commute.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tiny nits/suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The two &quot;screenshots&quot; have a different background blue color fade going on.  Is that on purpose?  Either color scheme is fine, but I slightly prefer the shades on the question view.&#xD;&#xA;2. As [@JayBazuzi](http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/605/jay-bazuzi) pointed out in the comments above, the cyclist is hunched over. It would hurt less to look at that cyclist if they had a straighter back. While it is common to see cyclists hunched over like that, the preferred posture is bending at the hips and keeping your back fairly straight. (because that gives the muscles in your torso more leverage making it easier to keep weight off of your hands, because it's generally better for your back, and in some cases because it's more aerodynamic).&#xD;&#xA;3. The more I stare at the design, the more it feels like riding on an oppressively hot day where the sun beats down and there's no shade. Maybe a tree somewhere? Or a hint of some water somewhere? I get thirsty looking at the pages&#xD;&#xA;4. I like the &quot;road sign&quot; details, and was thinking having the accepted answer number highlight look like one would be nice.  I'm thinking specifically a european advisory speed limit sign (I believe Australia uses the same scheme) which is white text on a square blue background (rounded corners) with or without a thin white border, like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zeichen_380.svg or the 130 on this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zeichen_393.svg (the red circles are mandatory speed limits). (but with a blue that fits the rest of the color scheme better, of course)" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I'd like to have this done before [the site launches](http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/389/design-for-bicycles-stack-exchange) early this coming week. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the moment, as per this page, we're [maintaining the tags separately](http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/375/maintenance-and-repair-tags-is-one-or-both-of-these-superflous/376#376). If [the merge suggestion](http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/375/maintenance-and-repair-tags-is-one-or-both-of-these-superflous/393#393) ever becomes more popular, we can merge the tags at that point.

Anything that sounds otherwise is really really minor details. If we go live with this design exactly like this I'd be happy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like the logo, it basically says &quot;I love bikes&quot; to me, which is a sentiment I can go for. I won't be surprised if some people don't like a heart as a logo.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The whole design is a wee bit whimsical, which I like and some won't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think maybe you were thinking of a sort of &quot;vintage&quot; thing with the texture, but it also reminds me of a road surface, which is a nice touch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the most part your design is about riding the bike, while most of our questions are about the mechanics of the bike.  The design looks more like riding on a day off than any kind of commute.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tiny nits/suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The two &quot;screenshots&quot; have a different background blue color fade going on.  Is that on purpose?  Either color scheme is fine, but I slightly prefer the shades on the question view.&#xD;&#xA;2. As [@JayBazuzi](http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/605/jay-bazuzi) pointed out in the comments above, the cyclist is hunched over. It would hurt less to look at that cyclist if they had a straighter back. While it is common to see cyclists hunched over like that, the preferred posture is bending at the hips and keeping your back fairly straight. (because that gives the muscles in your torso more leverage making it easier to keep weight off of your hands, because it's generally better for your back, and in some cases because it's more aerodynamic).&#xD;&#xA;3. The more I stare at the design, the more it feels like riding on an oppressively hot day where the sun beats down and there's no shade. Maybe a tree somewhere? Or a hint of some water somewhere? I get thirsty looking at the pages&#xD;&#xA;4. I like the &quot;road sign&quot; details, and was thinking having the accepted answer number highlight look like one would be nice.  I'm thinking specifically a european advisory speed limit sign (I believe Australia uses the same scheme) which is white text on a square blue background (rounded corners) with or without a thin white border, like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zeichen_380.svg or the 130 on this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zeichen_393.svg (the red circles are mandatory speed limits). (but with a blue that fits the rest of the color scheme better, of course)&#xD;&#xA;5. I kinda wish the decoration on tags made me think of bicycles in some way... Maybe something that looks a bit like the downtube company branding some manufacturers use. Most bikes the downtube branding is just straight contrasting color lettering/logos on the frame, but there's a classic style some use where that part of the tube is a different color (often with a little striping at both ends).

I think that, as far as bikes are concerned, you should take note of how much more sophisticated and high-tech bikes are than anything else on the roads. Carbon fibre is commonplace on bikes, not so on cars, they are stuck on steel and only just dabbling with aluminium which is old-tech for bikes. Bikes also can have electronic gears and time-trial machines use every aerodynamic trick in the wind-tunnel-hand-book. Fabrics for cycle clothing are also light years ahead of anything in the High Street or catwalk. LED lights were pioneered on bikes and are just making their way onto cars. Put simply, although we all have childhood memories of cycling, cycling is essentially a high-tech game with nothing vintage about it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;'Solo cyclist'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have been out and about on the bike today and I could not help but notice how many people were cycling in groups. When it is sunny weather it seems there are more people in groups than going solo. I think that the site is about community and that could be reflected by a diverse selection of riders on different styles of bikes. Inclusiveness is part of what the questions and answers are about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why Off-road?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The majority of questions on the site seem to be from people that ride for a mix of utility and pleasure. I personally view off-road mountain-biking as a bit 1980's, nowadays bikes are to be found in the city and along canal towpaths rather than off-road, as was the fashion when the 'car was king'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is wrong with sky blue skies?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Call me picky, but I like blue skies to be blue. Can we experiment with some different gradients? 'Simpsons' title sequence has a blue sky that is blue sky colour, as does the view out of my window now. There are lots of blues that say sky, I am just not feeling it with this one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Heart Logo and buttons&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like the heart logo, however I feel we could do a bit more with the existing bicycle road sign colour palette. Around here (UK) we have signs in blue, e.g:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With road signs red means stop, take attention, hazard ahead and so forth. Green has its own meanings, however, for bikes that is the colour of a cycle lane, i.e. the tarmac is painted green. I feel we already have a few colours that can be made to work with the design.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, the heart might work really well if in green. This will mean that the favicon does not look like some dating site or my little pony site. This may appease the naysayers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Randomly thrown in ideas&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am an admire of the cycle artwork that goes with 'Critical Mass' rather than Tour-de-France wannabee-ism, as you get in 'Future Publishing' style magazines. Andy Singer's series was excellent as were Ken Avidor's 'Road Kill Bill' cartoons that could be found in 'Carbusters' magazine a decade ago when it was underground, edgy and subversive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The site is also a global affair the sphere-style hills could have some cartoon-ified coastlines that are notionally of continents. We could play with some ideas of scale.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I was impressed by the UK train adverts that Virgin put out a while back. We could do something similar with bicycles going overhead of gridlocked traffic, maybe doing the black and white grey for the cars and true technicolor for the bikes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And finally... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We haven't decided on a strap line, 'It is about the bike!' might work as a working title rather than 'lorem ipsrubbish' that designers pretend to work with. &#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/RiAxK.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/y8deg.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/DYqIH.jpg" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

For editing other people's posts, this should be easy enough: anybody can propose an edit and some other higher-rep users can approve it.  If you're one of those 11 non-moderator people over 2000 rep points do please pay attention to proposed edits.&#xD;&#xA;2. For tag wiki edits it's the same thing, just fewer users that can approve.&#xD;&#xA;3. For everything else, leave a comment on the post and flag it for moderator attention. We will be happy to close, reopen, migrate, protect or delete questions or anwers that need it, especially if there's comments from multiple users saying that's what needs to happen.&#xD;&#xA;4.

Congratulations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The HTML.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Why&#xD;&#xA;&gt; During the brainstorming phase, I asked myself, why do people ride bicycles if they have a choice of driving a car, or why do they choose cycling if there are other forms of exercise?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I was offered a job in a further-away office I thought, &quot;I'm either going to have to move apartments: again. Or, get a faster bike: to go the further distance.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I now commute an hour each way, by bike. It's regular exercise, because it's commuting (though I might also do it if I had the leisure).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that the motivation, of many [men](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/3335) at least, is to go fast and far.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are several categories of biking:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Road (racing, training, touring)&#xD;&#xA;* Off-road (trails)&#xD;&#xA;* Hybrid (urban, leisure, utility)&#xD;&#xA;* And others: recumbents, children, cargo, trendy bikes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Bicycles - Stack Exchange is for people who build and repair bicycles, people who train cycling, or commute on bicycles.](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/faq)&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;#Myself&#xD;&#xA;&gt; As a one-time bicycle lover myself, I thought about personal freedom, accessibility, low cost and being in touch with the great outdoors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes my first bike was the first time I left my neighbourhood alone, to go exploring. It is relatively cheap.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And the outdoors are great (I don't know how people manage 'exercise bikes' and 'trainers' indoors: I get warm and want a fan). Outside there's always as good a breeze as you're willing to cycle into.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It can be, is, easier than walking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; So for the design, I wanted to capture the feeling of riding a bike, rather than focusing on the bike as an object.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Feeling of riding a bike&#xD;&#xA;The feeling of riding a bike, for me, is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Brighter than in-doors (or darker at night and winter)&#xD;&#xA;* Balance (shoes and pedals)&#xD;&#xA;* Acceleration (setting off, little effort at low speeds, up-shifting)&#xD;&#xA;* Gliding (coasting or free-wheeling)&#xD;&#xA;* Smooth (cycling feet)&#xD;&#xA;* Faster heart and deeper breathing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reality is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* 20+ mph (32+ kph)&#xD;&#xA;* Top speed limited by wind resistance: so it's like flying&#xD;&#xA;* $1500 for a new commuting bike with accessories and free service costs less than the public transit fares for a year&#xD;&#xA;* A year-round commute is feasible: I've easily ridden in -8C through +38C (17F through 100F) temperatures for an hour each way, every weekday (except about 10 days for rain and wind and health) since March 2011, wearing basic cotton clothing and gloves (and sunscreen) etc. Winter is warm, and summer is cool (there's a breeze).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's the practical, commuting 20 km in an hour. One can cross the city about as fast on a bike as by bus and subway and tram/streetcar.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a couple of hours of cycling you can burn 1000 calories. Pre-hydrate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other people post on the forum about road bikes/races, and about off-road mountain biking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Focusing on the bike as an object&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A major purpose of the site is to Q+A about bikes as objects (here's an [interesting advertisement](http://vimeo.com/18472550)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tires. Brakes. Gloves. Bearings. Parts. Traffic skills. Maintenance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Art style&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Riding a bicycle is a very personal and independent choice. I wanted the design to reflect that. I believe a hand illustrated art style gives it a more personal touch, and the slightly vintage treatment makes it more timeless.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A poster is better than a photo which could get old.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SF is another way to make a timeless treatment (Bruce Sterling's novelette [Bicycle Repairman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_Repairman) won the Hugo).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Been around for a long time&#xD;&#xA;&gt; After all, bicycles have been around for a long time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Been around, eh? Know what I mean?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mine's fairly new, and maintained. It's better than my previous one which was new for $130 two years ago (and which is fine for an easy cycle half an hour and back: I lend it for riding to the swimming pool).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The bikes people write about are often new or used, and are usually not department store bikes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You might find modern bikes surprisingly light and fast.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Poster&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Since the design is entirely focused on a &quot;feeling,&quot; I decided to design a poster for our bicycles site first.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nice poster.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should see [Neil Fein's awesome flyer](http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/311/flyers-for-people-to-use/312#312).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; That way, I didn't have the distraction of the constraints I normally face when creating a design for the web.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Off-topic do you have a reading list to recommend? About design?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Rycp.jpg&quot;&gt;![Bicycles Poster][2]&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the picture above I'd like to see a narrower white line, to make the lanes wider. I'm glad to see you've already done that in the current design.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The above reminds me of Normandy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Above is the poster I came up with. I believe the texture, color scheme and minimalist style work towards the goal I was aiming for. From there I transfered the visual elements onto the site design.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Please keep in mind, not all of the site elements are present in these two mockups.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ads. And you're showing the header and the footer on the same fold.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I incorporated some visuals related to bicycles and cycling, e.g. road signs and cogs. But I was careful to not to make it overly &quot;themey.&quot; Also, I tried to fit all of the design in one image, so it looks busier than the live site will be.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I'm pleased with the overall design. It did capture the feel I was going after. The site has a unique identity, while maintaining the feeling of the Stack Exchange family. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; I'd love to hear your feedback. If there are no major design changes, I'm aiming to launch the site next Tuesday. So an early congrats from me!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cheers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/our-designer-in-residence-jin-yang/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Rycp.jpg" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

We've actually had enough posts for one a week through another week from now, but we released (published) some very close together (right as soon as they were ready) and never kept any kind of cache of ready posts. There's always going to be some irregularity with when posts are *written*, sometimes a few in one week, sometimes a dry spell for a couple weeks. Better to make the release schedule more like a smooth one-a-week thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think we should keep to a schedule, probably 1 post a week on Mondays.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we happen to have an extra post or two in a week, wait to do anything with them. Most posts can sit around a week or three and still be just as relevant. Treat it as a queue and publish the oldest post in the queue sometime on Monday and leave the rest alone. Only jump the queue or release early if there's a timeliness aspect (such as [the launch blog post](http://bicycles.blogoverflow.com/2011/08/bicycles-launched/) or zenbike's [Tour post](http://bicycles.blogoverflow.com/2011/07/its-tour-time/)). And if we do have a post jump the queue because of timeliness, consider delaying everything else a week.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we ever get to the point where the queue of ready posts is too big, we can start publishing 2 a week or alternate between 1-a-week and 2-a-week or something like that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll try to write something (maybe about how car drivers should deal with cyclists), but given my own schedule it'd probably be ready for posting on August 28th at the earliest, and likely more like September 5th.

The problem is when users upload huge photos to illustrate something they usually don't need very high resolution - for example, it might be a photo of a bicycle lock and it doesn't need to be 2000K by 1500K and weigh 700 kilobytes - it can be much smaller and will still look good. Downloading huge pictures is a problem for many users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Turns out][2] (thanks to [user Jeremy Banks][3] for that answer!) imgur.com allows to downscale images automatically by appending letter `l` between the name and the extension.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So you upload an image and you get a link like https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xulw9.jpg and when you insert `l` you get https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xulw9l.jpg (notice `l` before `.jpg`) and that automatically makes imgur.com serve a smaller version of the image that weighs much less.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I kindly ask all users who add pictures to use this feature unless of course you need that super high resolution to illustrate some super fine details.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/101439/132564&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/101439/please-do-something-to-encourage-people-to-scale-down-their-giant-heavyweight-pho/101446#101446&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/134300/jeremy-banks" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

While we don't need to make all of our posts dialup-friendly, there are people who access the site over cell phones and androids, which can be slow. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also get smaller versions of pictures when using images from Flickr, but the process takes a little bit longer. From [the photo page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilfein/5980133138/in/set-72157627165790423), click on the &quot;share&quot; menu above the photo. Under the option &quot;Grab the HTML/BB Code&quot;, make sure that &quot;HTML&quot; is selected, then choose a small version of the image, as small as you can use yet maintain the amount of detail you need. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Flickr also has a nice feature: Links generated in this way are automatically clickable, with a link that leads you back to the photo page where you can view a larger version of the photo at your leisure. Here's an example: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilfein/5980133138/&quot; title=&quot;Sun by neilfein, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6027/5980133138_516727d62f.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;Sun&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that this is clickable.

(They can disallow linking to the photo all together if they want.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Flickr also lets you search for photos by license, so you can find creative-commons licensed pictures to illustrate a post. This is handy, as it lets you avoid using copyrighted stuff. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(In general, hotlinking to images elsewhere on the net is discouraged, as it steals bandwitdth from those servers, but imgur and Flickr are both *designed* for hotlinking in this manner.)

May or may not actually be attached. Pump, lights, water bottle, tools, cyclometer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not quite sure about things that bolt on (or otherwise attach semi-permanently) but that have debatable essentialness like fenders/mudguards, racks, baskets, bottle cage, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But it does seem like we're a bit inconsistent with how we use these two tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Right now [tag:equipment] has description that doesn't explain anything and covers everything: &quot;Equipment (as opposed to riding or technique).&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, how should we be using these tags? What should each of their tag wiki excerpts say? Does the answer to these questions mean we should go do some tag &#xD;&#xA;cleanup on those questions?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Update:&#xD;&#xA;Tag cleanup finished.  [tag:equipment] is marked deprecated, [tag:components] is  a synonym for [tag:parts] and all relevant tag wiki excerpts updated. Retagged everything that had [tag:equipment], sometimes simply removing the tag, other times replacing with [tag:parts], [tag:accessories] and/or [tag:tools] as appropriate for the question.

While we don't need to make all of our posts dialup-friendly, there are people who access the site over cell phones and androids, which can be slow. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also get smaller versions of pictures when using images from Flickr, but the process takes a little bit longer. From [the photo page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilfein/5980133138/in/set-72157627165790423), click on the &quot;share&quot; menu above the photo. Under the option &quot;Grab the HTML/BB Code&quot;, make sure that &quot;HTML&quot; is selected, then choose a small version of the image, as small as you can use yet maintain the amount of detail you need. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Flickr also has a nice feature: Links generated in this way are automatically clickable, with a link that leads you back to the photo page where you can view a larger version of the photo at your leisure. Here's an example of a scaled-down file taken from a very large original image: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilfein/6039484949/&quot; title=&quot;Chopper by neilfein, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6129/6039484949_35bf1014f2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; alt=&quot;Chopper&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that this is clickable.

(They can disallow linking to the photo all together if they want.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Flickr also lets you search for photos by license, so you can find creative-commons licensed pictures to illustrate a post. This is handy, as it lets you avoid using copyrighted stuff. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(In general, hotlinking to images elsewhere on the net is discouraged, as it steals bandwitdth from those servers, but imgur and Flickr are both *designed* for hotlinking in this manner.)

What would a shopkeeper be inclined to keep in a stack next to the cash register? Think cheap, eye-catching, useful. Maybe there's something that riders can use in winter?

Please chime in with any questions, concerns or improvements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Water Bottles** - Jin is working on a design that incorporates [your recommendations][1]. That design will hit the meta board for pressing last-minute input before it goes to the presses. The beautiful bottles should be available for purchase in the Stack Exchange store and free to high-rep users by the middle of September, if not earlier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Bike Contest for Victims of Theft** &#xD;&#xA; - We're still working on securing a sponsor for this campaign. It is looking increasingly likely that we will go ahead with the contest without a sponsor. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - it means we can give what we want, where we want - though it may limit our budget for near-future initiatives.&#xD;&#xA; - Location: I'm strongly considering limiting the scope of this contest to **NYC + NJ** or just the 5 boroughs. This is the first Bicycles.SE contest and I want to make sure it is a success. It will be easier to make it so if I/we focus efforts within a defined area - a city where bike theft is rampant &amp; I can get my hands greasy. If this works, the rest of the US, Canada, the UK &amp; Down Under will get a shot at winning something awesome before long.&#xD;&#xA; - I've been emailing mods in re: **a vetting process** to ensure contestants are real-life victims of bike theft. Most victims I know never filed a police report and long ago lost a receipt - if they ever got one in the first place; documentation of bike theft is a tenuous thing. **One Solution**: Require that contestants provide 10 &quot;witness&quot; upvotes. While this too can be faked, the mere opportunity to win a new bike doesn't seem worth the effort of convincing 10 friends to register &amp; vote under false pretense.&#xD;&#xA;- **Local Bike Shop (LBS) &quot;Stack Artifact&quot;** - As @Jason S [brought to our attention][2], this community could use a token to provide to fellow riders and bike shop employees that says &quot;Ask your bike questions here. Share your bike knowledge with us.&quot; Are we talking about **stickers**? I'm not sure. Maybe I'm desensitized to the novelty of stickers. Do cyclists have a use for stickers - maybe something reflective? What would you be inclined to stick on your helmet? What would you want to carry with you on an organized charity ride? What would a shopkeeper be inclined to keep in a stack next to the cash register? Think cheap, eye-catching, useful. Maybe there's something that riders can use in winter? Let's get some ideas and try to get something finalized by the end of the month.

You need to see if Carlton Reid at BikeBiz can help. Equally, in the U.S. if there is a similar publication.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the UK every LBS gets stuff from Madison - the sole UK distributors for Shimano. They can and do get promotional material to their stockists. Also, 'zyro' - sellers of Cateye - have a mini catalog that they get out to the shops.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the US there will be a similar wholesaler that bike shops HAVE to deal with, e.g. to get Shimano spares that are not available somewhere else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another thought, in retail you cannot give potential customers bike catalogues as it is counter productive (they go to a competitor and get a better price). With-hold the catalogue and they are more likely to come back. But, if you work in bicycle sales and strike up a relationship, you want customers to come back to you by name. Therefore, sales staff need a business card rather than a catalogue/brochure to give out to people they make personal sales pitches to. These are generally lacking in the industry.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am generally not sure that bike shops are the way to go. I think product managers further up the food chain could do with a place to get common answers to problems with their products sorted, at the bike shop level a customer with a question is a potential sale and pushing them to online 'crowd sourced' help isn't necessarily what you want. Then again, from the perspective of the guy in the shop, if customer comes in and asks for e.g. 'a spare hitch for a Burley XYZ trailer' on a busy Saturday, how does that member of staff find out the part that is needed? Bikes.se could come in handy if e.g. Burley pre-seeded bikes.se with +A pertaining to their products.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that there are a lot of cyclists that don't use smartphones, regular phones are what they will have. Hence I think that stickers with the QR code and a short URL are 'needed'. The missing element might be cycling advocacy. If we went in with a cycling advocacy group, e.g. to have a 'Bikes Belong' sticker with 'find me online at bikes.se/zydfa' might be useful for getting stickers to have a message and be useful. If someone didn't want my bike parked on their railings, if some stunning supermodel wanted to ask me out on a date(!) because they liked the cut of my handlebar tape or if I wanted to swap details with someone that I met on the way this could be useful - social networking in the real world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for implementing it technically, I don't think this would be hard."

However, I think maybe those regional questions need a bit of extra attention to make sure that they're practical, answerable, and not too localized.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think we'll always need to allow some amount of region-specific questions because &#xD;&#xA;laws, available products, and culture vary from place to place. Cycling has a certain amount of regionality inherent to it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm unable to think of any clear hard-and-fast rules for dealing with regional questions, and can only think of rough guidelines. What's too small a geographic area? Ultimately it's going to be a judgement call whether or not the question is likely `to ever help any future visitors`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By &quot;too localized&quot; I mean something like the close reason in [our faq](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/faq#close):&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * **too localized**  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; This question is unlikely to ever help any future visitors; it is only relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily &#xD;&#xA;narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that the &quot;too localized&quot; criteria aren't strictly about geographic area. I'm thinking of geographic area as just one way that questions have too narrow a scope. If it's about a topic that affects everybody in a relatively small area and we have a lot of users in that area, that's very different than if it's a relatively obscure topic in that same geographic area.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also seems to me like some of the &quot;bad&quot; regional questions are only part too-localized. They often seem also subjective and/or poll-style. [Bicycle tours in Athens](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/1913/bike-tours-in-athens-greece) isn't just a small geographic area, it's a poll for subjective answers, it's probably only relevant to a small number of the local cyclists, I don't think we have enough local experts to evaluate answers, and it's difficult to do any objective research without having been there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, [helmets laws in australia and new zealand](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2211/should-i-be-concerned-about-new-helmet-laws) is a bigger geographic area, more objectively answerable, affects every cyclist in those countries, and is possible to research on the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps one of the criteria for too-localized should be if the question sits unanswered too long."

Some basic questions could be tagged on, for instance, how long the bike was left unattended, rough time that it was stolen, (or time noticed that it was stolen), the lock that had been used, type of bike, colour of bike, value of bike, presence of CCTV, street furniture attached to, location (e.g. street), presence of other bikes parked in the vicinity, reported to the police, how long it took for a replacement steed to be purchased, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Such a survey can be put into an excel chart and wrapped up into a press release which can then be given to mainstream media to get more site visitors. An 'unexpected finding', e.g. 'NY geeks most likely to get bikes stolen on Tuesdays' should emerge from the survey and be 'newsworthy', even if it confirms what we already know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the 'angle', 'what got you mad when you had your bike nicked' is probably more insightful. I have had three bikes stolen, once the attitude of my employer got me mad, once my being drunk (at a party, trusting those present) got me mad and once the attitude of the police got me mad. The turkey of the lock that I owned also got me mad the last time. The insight of the 'what got me mad' angle is personal (e.g. I could have parked up somewhere more sensible) and societal (e.g. employers should provide secure facilities).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know beautiful storytelling has its value, it is just I feel that something good could come out of a collective hindsight thing."

In my mind, the criteria for winning is the biggest problem. We need a clear and concise criteria before we move on.

Despite my personal failure, this contest may indeed be too local to move forward as it is. Let me know what you think about this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Others concerns - the &quot;sock puppet&quot; concern, in particular - raise issues about **upvoting contests in general**. Next week, we'll be talking at SE HQ about the viability of this type of contest, which I think is a flawed but highly effective means of bringing new users to this and other SE sites.

As such, I designed this contest - with much help from the moderators &amp; not enough help from the community (my fault) - with the outside in mind:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A NYC-based Stolen Bike contest is specific &amp; catchy - I can promote it to blogs &amp; influencers&#xD;&#xA; - A vote-based contest gives participants incentive to reach out + pull in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A variety of concerns have surfaced. Some of the most pressing:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Too localized&#xD;&#xA; - Little benefit to existing &amp; high-rep users&#xD;&#xA; - Relies on back-end data (how to confirm a vote was delivered by a &quot;new user&quot;)&#xD;&#xA; - Criteria for winning vague or &quot;overwrought&quot;&#xD;&#xA; - Incentivizes creation of &quot;sock puppet&quot; users&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many of your concerns are **specific to the Stolen Bike contest**. In my mind, the criteria for winning is the biggest problem. We need a clear and concise criteria before we move on. As for &quot;too localized&quot; - I failed to adequately communicate that this was a pilot program to establish a contest model we can later take global. Despite my personal failure, this contest may indeed be too local to move forward as it is. Let me know what you think about this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other concerns - the &quot;sock puppet&quot; concern, in particular - raise issues about **upvoting contests in general**. Next week, we'll be talking at SE HQ about the viability of this type of contest, which I think is a flawed but highly effective means of bringing new users to this and other SE sites. (We'll be discussing, among other things, whether or not it is possible or even useful to allow no-rep outsiders to upvote answers posed in a specific class of &quot;contest questions.&quot;) Let me know if you have any concerns about upvoting contests or ideas about other contest models that encourage users to &quot;reach out.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the moment, the Stolen Bike Contest is on hold. I'll give you an update on where we stand at the end of next week. Until then, let the ideas flow. This is your site.

I don't know why they have to be so boring! At the retail level this is a problem when people ask for one specifically and you show them the 'efforts' on sale for them to say no thanks! They have a £5 burning in their pocket but there is nothing that just grabs them. Consequently I believe that a series of well designed water bottles will be well received.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hence my suggestion is for a bike bottle design competition. With the other competition on hold, we might be able to run with something of global appeal. We could put down a few pointers of what we are looking for as well as a few technical pointers - a limit on the colours, whether those colours can include hi-viz and printing accuracy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We don't need to tie the design down to anything to do with bicycles.se except that will have to appear in the design somewhere. Also the artwork can be whatever, not anything to do with the site graphics.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Things that I would like to see get entered might include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Technical use of the design, e.g. ml/pint/mouthfuls measurements on the side, a chain stretch measurement guide, miles to km ready reckoner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - 'Pro-bike' (anti-car) slogans - '100% unleaded high octane water'/'one less car'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - 'Retro passion' - the designer for the film TRON2 came up with the 2011 HRT F1 car, using 'retro' checkered flag designs and silly slogans (because the HRT team had no sponsors)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - 'Fish tank' - the womens lib 'fish on a bicycle' idea&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - 'What car would Jesus drive?' (with some 'find answers to this on bikes.se' quip)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - 'Adbusters' subvertising of well known slogans, e.g. 'just ride it!'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Things That Sell. 'I [heart] my bike'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - 'Cyclist on board'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To see what I mean by rubbish bike bottle designs (no offence to Wiggle, they are just representative): http://www.wiggle.co.uk/cycle/water-bottles/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You don't even get 'Cafe de Colombia'/'Coke' and other Tour de France bottle designs nowadays.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We could spam every single bike/green/education org on the planet with such a competition, maybe even have a javascript app to render a flat design onto a bottle as part of the entry form. Entrants could have a reasonable prize given to them if they win. We could have the vote online to get the finalists sorted out with an invited panel of do-gooder celebrity cyclists having the final say. A gold/silver/bronze + public choice to get four designs sorted, the idea being to make these into a commercial success. (There *is* a market for some quality bottles.)"

(Obviously this would depend heavily on the specific situation.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **What are your preferred ways to steer new users?**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New users often approach the site as if it were a forum. I've seen people on other SE sites take offense at the standard greeting &quot;Welcome to the site, please read the FAQ&quot; as coming across as &quot;I've been here for a long time, and I know better than you&quot;. How can we strike a balance between being welcoming and gently correcting typical new-user problems? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **What are your thoughts on site publicity?**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should we promote the site heavily, bringing in a lot of new blood quickly, or let it develop organically? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **As a user, what have you done for the site?** &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are specific contributions that you're proud of?

I may be able to help there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## How to participate in advocacy when there's a foot of snow on the ground&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **A little weather doesn't have to stop you from riding.** Check our [tag:snow], [tag:winter] and [tag:ice] tags, and also http://www.icebike.org/. Basically get a hard-tail mountain bike with disc brakes, put wide studded tires on it, bundle up so your ears, toes and fingers are well protected, and *ride*.  &#xD;&#xA;Here's some inspirational links:&#xD;&#xA;  * [Video of Surly Pugsley on snow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJT5bEBSLIM)&#xD;&#xA;  * [Bike riders at South Pole](http://www.icebike.org/Gallery97/0009.jpg)&#xD;&#xA;  * [Winter Cycling in Moscow](http://www.icebike.org/Articles/Moscow.htm) (if people can ride bikes in winter in Moscow, you can probably ride a bike in winter where you are)&#xD;&#xA;  * [Winter Biking in Minneapolis](http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/bicycles/winter-biking.asp) (I believe they're the biggest cycling city in the US now)&#xD;&#xA;2. Most of advocacy has little to do with it being riding season.  &#xD;&#xA;Reaching bicycle riders to grow an advocacy group's membership and funding is going to be easiest to do during good weather.  &#xD;&#xA;However, a lot of the core advocacy work is related to informing governments how to build good bicycling infrastructure, preserving/finding funding for bike projects, etc.  Those need to happen any time that congress is in session, city council meets, the transportation planning board meets, etc..."

We should use it with a few standard Wordpress features/plugins such as a poll or questionnaire module.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In time we might 'downgrade' the Q+A from being the be-all-and-end-all of the site. Q+A could be how we get new followers, e.g. person with new bike stuck on how to get their gears to work could do a Google search, come to us, find the information they need and then find the wonders of the blog pages/posts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For an advocacy group there is not a lot of point in them asking just their own members, e.g. if the *'Monster Off-Road Penny Farthing Racing Club'* asked their members about whether it was 8'okay to rest a foot on car roofs when stopped at the lights'* then they would get an expected answer/skewed opinion of *'yes'*, if they were to ask a wider audience then they would get *'no - it gives cycling a bad name'*. Bikes.se would offer them that wider audience of regular cyclists to poll/Q+A. That audience would be arrived at by the Q+A in with diffusion across to the blog.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We should consider giving advocacy groups 'contributor' access to the blog so that they can put their own stuff up on there - press releases, 'news', 'surveys' and so on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;People crave content, but, for me, most bike websites are not working. It would be really good if the blog had lots and lots of stuff so that it was 'sticky', making you want to come back to it every day. Much like 'Slashdot' for techies. IMHO press releases for new product ranges would be okay too, however it would be good to get the advocacy groups contributing first, and with a passion. Give them the tools - so they can post their own stuff - and they will contribute. Raise hurdles and it won't happen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the off-season...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the UK the cycling season is May to September. From a retail perspective the tap goes on at the start of May and off at the end of September. Not even Christmas is of any relevance (box shifters took the kids bike market for that away from the local bike shop at or around the time bike shops started focusing on the high end sales and the bike industry does not bring out any 'must have' gifts for the cyclist).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IMHO the best time to do advocacy is during the off season. Too many 'decision making important people' are on holiday during all of August or catching up in September. Catch them on a grey winter's day with attractive ideas about summer cycling and they are more likely to have time for you. Plus, to get anything done in this world, takes time and persistence. So all year round is needed anyway." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

And the idea of a sponsored question sounds like it could create a conflict of interest. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Why easy questions are bad for the site**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions that are easy to answer by anyone are, by definition, bad questions because Stack Exchange is designed to produce good answers. Unless I'm missing the point here, it sounds like you want to ask some sponsored questions that will be easy to answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Attracting new users to the site means bringing volumes of them here. The Stack Exchange system is set up to actively discourage users who don't want to work in the Q&amp;A format, leaving only the ones who will generate good content. These two obviously work at cross purposes, and I don't envy anyone the task of getting new users here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On Stack Exchange, good information will be easy to find; as the good answers are upvoted, they'll rise to the top of the page. **Writing good questions and answers is supposed to be a difficult thing, not an easy one.** New users - and getting them here is the point of this exercise - will see a question like this and assume it's representative of the site.  **Allowing questions that are easy to answer because they're sponsored would be watering down the site.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The cycle accessory question you link to would almost certainly be closed were it asked today. It's a chatty question that serves no real purpose. What do the upvotes mean on those answers? That someone liked these accessories? That the upvoters agree with the answers? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarly, introducing a Q&amp;A thread that's easy to participate in would defeat the purpose of the site. We want questions that produce answers by experts. If there are many answers possible, then, a few [glossary](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/glossary) community wiki questions to the side, such a question isn't a very good one or it isn't being asked properly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sponsored questions and conflicts of interest**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's say that a way can be found to get past all of that. Well and good. If, say, Tektro wanted to sponsor a question about brake levers, would mods be bound to keep it open? What about users who feel that they make horrible components? (Personally, I love my Tektro brakes, but I digress.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Would users be bound to avoid [sharing their extensive knowledge](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/6286/do-cyclocross-interrupter-touring-brake-levers-reduce-brake-performance/6310#6310) if it's bad for the sponsor? Are we stuck with a sponsored question if it's a bad question? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Suggestions**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similar to how blog functionality was introduced with Blog Overflow, and moderator elections are carried out on a dedicated election page, perhaps a new functionality for contests can be created. This not only wouldn't compromise the site but it would allow for greater flexibility in building the perfect promotional/contest engine.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While most efforts to find new ways to use the Q&amp;A format seem to end fairly badly, some do not.

The park websites don't mention this. As primarily a fixed gear cyclist from a large city, I find most of the roads around here unfortunately just to unsafe for a leisurely roll. (Not to say that you cannot get to where you need to go in four lanes of 45mph traffic, but I'd rather die for a reason then just for the hell of it ya'know).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having said that. A question like &quot;Where can I ride my bike in Brecksvill, OH?&quot; I feel would be to localized to be of much use to many people. However, &quot;What is the cycling situation in the Greater Cleveland area?&quot; (though poorly worded) is a question that could be of relevance. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although, &quot;Recommendations for a decent Shop in Brecksville, OH?&quot; (i.e. One that won't rip you off, treat you poorly, or is generally opted by bastards) while rather localized could be of great help to any cyclist, miles from where they started in the metropark system, finding themselves stranded here for whatever reason, thinking their situation dire. One could easily look around and assume that its time to phone a friend and hope for a pickup (or hitchhike).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I feel that if one, as a cyclist, would read a question and think *&quot;Ohmygosh, I would hope to know that were the situation applicable&quot;*, Then it is a question that deserves a chance to be answered with human knowledge. If it is a question that can be answered with a sentence and a link, or 5 seconds on google then I believe that to me a validation that (as your teacher always told you) there are no dumb questions, only dumb people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ultimately, although still rather new (and trying the become more involved) to Stack Exchange, I find that the real value here is in the breadth &amp; depth of human knowledge available. Google &amp; such are fantastic tools, but there is simply no substitute for someone who knows what they are talking about. Localized wisdom can be just as valuable as knowledge of a more general sort." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In the early days of the site, we opened the question &#xD;&#xA;[What's your most useful cycle accessory?](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/573/whats-your-most-useful-cycle-accessory). We later opened [What are the utmost important things to bring on a ride?](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/3868/what-are-the-utmost-important-things-to-bring-on-a-ride). While the first question is more general, and the second is more geared towards day rides, this question doesn't bring anything new to the party. It mentions commuting, but doesn't bring up any concerns specific to commuting; this answers to this question could easily be answering ether of the two earlier questions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

(even if the automatic quality filters thought it was too short)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I view the main duty of a moderator as *dealing with flags* and supporting the community on the site. Often that can mean being the &quot;designated bad guy&quot; who closes or deletes something that people flagged, without any mention that the flags ever existed. If nobody flags a particular post, I may not even see it. I do look at a lot of the questions, but not all of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that it is a &quot;forumy&quot; question that's asking in a way that tends to encourage *discussion* more than *answers*. It's exactly what the &quot;not constructive&quot; close reason is there for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If I'd seen the question before it had any answers, I would've been very likely to intervene (comment suggesting changing to a more concretely answerable question, edit it into one myself). If I'd seen it before there were any answers and it had a couple votes to close and a flag request to close, I would've closed it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By the time I *did* see the question, it was a day or two after it was originally asked. I briefly contemplated some sort of intervention (closing?), but there were some decent answers. Good answers can save a borderline question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And more importantly, there were no votes to close the question and no flags on the question. (there were flags on a couple chatty comments that we deleted, though)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, because of the good answers, no votes to close and no flags, I left the question alone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If our community wants that question dead, I'd support that. If somebody wants to rewrite the question to be more constructive without invalidating the answers, that would be totally awesome and I would definitely support that if it needed my support.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you believe the question should be closed, vote to close it as &quot;not constructive&quot;."

If you've been on any of the `.moderated` newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. *Anyone* can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question *back into review/improve mode*. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... *happen*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Why do we close a question?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on *problems you face* or things you are trying to understand. The [don't ask](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask) section of the FAQ gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions belong elsewhere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, *broadly speaking* true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Is closing like deletion?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put &quot;into improve mode&quot; if you like, and are still visible for *anyone* to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different - they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What are the requirements for closing a question?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have 3000 reputation, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option &quot;this question does not belong here&quot;. That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Why can anyone vote to close/reopen**?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Firstly, anyone can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such) because it is *your site*. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How are moderators different?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Initially, as the reputation requirement rules out many users, you will see moderators doing most of the closing to guide the site and look after the content. As you gain in reputation, you get to join in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Ok, so how does it work?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Example close button][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Close vote reasons dialog][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Other votes][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.&#xD;&#xA; * The &quot;off topic&quot; page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. On SE betas, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind.&#xD;&#xA; * The other options are straight out closes.&#xD;&#xA; * Once you pick your option and click &quot;close&quot;, your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.&#xD;&#xA; * If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.&#xD;&#xA; * Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Close banner][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How does vote to re-open work?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A closed question has a &quot;reopen&quot; link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Re-open link][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What happens if I make a mistake?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't worry! Unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**My name appears on the bottom - isn't this going to cause problems with other users?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually there are two tools for this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * [Review][6]. Here, there are a number of options for seeing things that might need say editing. One of these is a tab for all questions with close votes. You are then free to look at the question and decide if you agree.&#xD;&#xA; * [Tools][7]. Commonly referred to as the &quot;10k tools&quot;, this page let's you see even more information - certain anonymous flags, re-open votes, delete votes etc. The important one for this is the re-open page. Here, you can see questions that might have been closed incorrectly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Entire post blatantly stolen from [this meta.crypto.se answer](http://meta.crypto.stackexchange.com/a/130/1677) by [Ninefingers](http://meta.crypto.stackexchange.com/users/46/ninefingers) and barely modified at all)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3F4V.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://crypto.stackexchange.com/review&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://crypto.stackexchange.com/tools" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Anyone want to tackle a blog post on bike lanes *designed* for wrong-way cycling? (I've been on a few of them.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From the answer: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The issue is actually quite complex. Some &quot;wrong-way&quot; routes can be quite safe if well-designed, marked, and implemented. Much of the data and research in this area is in French because &quot;contresens pistes cyclable&quot; have been implemented in several French cities such as Paris, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, and Lyon, among others. In addition, a few other countries have implemented similar bike ways, such as Belgium, Switzerland, Japan, and the Netherlands. In general, these &quot;counter-direction&quot; bikeways are in dense urban areas with many narrow one-way streets and restricted speed limits (usually, 30 to 40 km/h, or around 20 to 25 mph). A 200 page report from the Institut Federatif de Recherche sur Les Economies et Les Societes Indutrielles (one of the French research institutes) of the experiences in 5 French cities can be found [here][1] (in French) and a short PowerPoint presentation by the lead author of that study can be found [here][2] (again, in French). No accidents were observed on contresens bikeways in the study area during the period from 2002-6. A two-page illustrated brochure advocating the expansion of contresens urban pistes can be found [here][3]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; On a personal note, I was surprised when a contresens piste cyclable was marked on my narow one-way street in Paris. I initially thought it to be suicidal but after riding on it for two blocks I understood why it could be safer: a study of **every** bicycle fatality in Paris in 2005 had shown that the single largest cause of death was being right-hooked at intersections, and the contresens bikeways completely eliminated this danger.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.fubicy.org/spip.php?article157&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.fubicy.org/avon/moret/Moret/Contresens%20VaV.ppt&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.droitauvelo.org/DOC/FICHES/fiche1.pdf" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This would be because the site discusses audio and video. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What, exactly, would be done with video here? Just maintenance videos, or would it be more useful than that? I'm not saying video would be a bad thing here, but I'd rather not see answers that are just an embedded video. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Edit: &lt;strike&gt;I think the best way for you to go about this would be to present your case on [Meta Stack Overflow](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/),&lt;/strike&gt; [Note - this turned out to be incorrect. Leaving it here so as not to make the comments below nonsensical.] and use these examples as ammunition. It would be even better if you could present them with existing answers on the site that could have been much better if they had had embedded videos illustrating the point. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's more on [this page](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/66397/provide-a-way-to-embed-videos-in-answers) about embedding video on sites, and [this answer](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/104189/149375) seems to indicate that the SE folks are open to hearing these resuests.

A little overlap isn't a problem, as long as people are clear on where to ask a question. You'll need to figure out how to present this in your FAQ, as will we, if and when your proposal becomes a site. Something like &quot;Off-road, focusing on the issues faced off-road vehicles. While we cover off-road bicycles, questions about mechanical issues or general bicycle riding might get more answers at Bicycles.&quot; But who knows?

This is an awesome opportunity to challenge yourself to commute by bike more often, and with the weather getting warmer, it's the perfect time to get back into the habit of using your bike to get around.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Individual communities have bike challenges, with prizes sponsored by local bike advocacy groups, cycling shops, and bike groups. The League of American Bicyclists has a webpage where you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bikeleague.org/programs/bikemonth/events.php&quot;&gt;look up official Bike Month events&lt;/a&gt; in your community. Not all events are listed on this site, so you should also do a web search for &lt;em&gt;bike to work &amp;lt;city name&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; and see what you can find. For example, Oregon has the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.walknbike.org/&quot;&gt;Walk and Bike Month Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, New York City has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/bike_month&quot;&gt;Bike Month NYC&lt;/a&gt;, San Francisco Bay Area has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youcanbikethere.com/&quot;&gt;Bike to Work Day&lt;/a&gt;, and dozens of other communities across the US have their own programs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Not every city's Bike to Work events are on the &quot;official&quot; dates, so make sure to check for local events right away so you don't miss out!&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you get geared up for spring commuting, don't forget to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/ask&quot;&gt;ask Bicycles Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; when you have questions about setting up your bike!"

The voting system doesn't work right. It would be too easy to get a shopping question with page of answers with the highest voted answers being the popular choices (and earlier written choices) instead of the best solutions or best-written answers. Nobody's going to read a long list of undifferentiated answers; they don't really help anybody.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would encourage people to ignore the phrasing of the question and pretend instead that the person asked the question we wish they'd asked. In other words, when you see &quot;Which jacket should I buy?&quot;, pretend they're asking how to pick a jacket for their particular needs and provide that type of information. Maybe include a few specific product recommendations with the reasons for them related to the general reasons. Even bad questions are likely to be left open if they have an awesome answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even better, edit the question into the better question that we wish they had asked. Make sure it will still lead to answers that will help the original questioner out, and try not to invalidate any existing answers. Edits that improve questions or answers are always welcome!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Notice on that shopping question that the upvoted answers are the ones that tell you how to find a jacket or are specific about why a given choice is good, and that the actual straight product recommendations never got any votes...

What is X worst at?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/#comment-52087&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The problem with some of the shopping recommendations is that it is often not possible to figure out which product is better based only on data published by the manufacturer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/#comment-52092&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Shopping” or “recommendation” questions are a pox on almost every Q&amp;A community; on Gaming and RPG, it’s game-rec.

We banned them right off the bat, and we are SO much better for it.

I agree that it's good to encourage healthy discussion. However, I don't think that closing and downvoting are inherently unfriendly, and I think the community is accepting of almost any answerable question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the end, I think it's hard to talk about this in general, so it's better to raise specific cases where you disagree and when possible to try to edit/improve content. For example, I recently edited the question &#xD;&#xA;http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/10821/how-does-a-two-wheel-drive-bike-work&#xD;&#xA;because I thought it contained the kernel of a great question. I agree with the original closing, though, because it was vague and unanswerable. I think it's worthy of reopening now, but I don't think there was anything wrong with closing it. Looking at other questions that have been closed recently, I really can't argue with most of them. For example, http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/10870/link-to-a-photo-of-eddy-merckx-seen-from-below-the-bike&#xD;&#xA;is searching for a very specific photograph, which is an impossibly specific request.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I upvote far more often than I downvote, but I generally downvote any question that seems inherently unanswerable, chatty (&quot;What is your favorite...?&quot;), or requests recommendation of a specific model or brand of something (answers to such questions expire almost instantly). In general, I think that I and others on the site tend to be pretty accepting of questions that are more subjective than other Stack Exchange Sites. The only major area where I seem to disagree with others is that I think that medical and especially first aid questions should be considered on-topic. When people downvote answers, they may either think that the answer is wrong or that it's not really an answer or would be more appropriate as a comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do you have specific questions where you disagree with everyone else? If so, I recommend either adding a comment about how why you think it is a good question, or to add a specific meta question. I agree that it's nice to add a comment about why you're downvoting, but it's not strictly necessary. And it's just as helpful for someone who likes a post to add a comment about why they like it as for someone who dislikes it to add a comment about why they dislike."

Downvoting someone's question or answer without explaining why leaves them to guess at why they were downvoted. It feels like a slap, getting a downvote like that. Requiring users to leave a comment while downvoting has been discussed on Meta.SO. However, filling out a comment to fill out a comment seems pointless, and it's important to preserve [voter anonymity](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/27534/see-who-is-upvoting-downvoting-my-question-answer). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As long as most users are leaving constructive feedback, I think we'll be fine.

OTOH, questions with a single upvote and a few answers with maybe 1 upvote hasn't really been &quot;rated&quot; by the Stackexchange system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So a single downvote (or upvote) shouldn't be treated as a big deal, it usually means the question simply struck someone as not being very good.

I think Stackexchange is better served by having multiple votes, i.e. by having multiple people state their opinion of a question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **More people need to vote.**  Not just on this site, big ones like ServerFault could use more voting, and I think it's a really bad sign on [Cooking.SE that in the past 3 months, I've voted an order of magnitude more than the next guy.][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If anything, I think SE, Inc. would be better off weighing in on threads like this one and emphasizing the official position &quot;comments are nice, but absolutely NOT required.&quot;  I'd guess there are people who might vote more except they feel they should take the time to comment on every downvote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **A comment on a marginal question is an invitation to fight.** There are people (e.g. that highest-rep guy on SciFi.SE) who *will* argue about your reasons for downvoting if you give them.  I don't think that necessarily applies here, but it's always a possibility.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**tl;dr:**  I don't downvote to troll, or to punish people, I downvote questions and answers I think aren't very good, and nothing more than that should be read into a downvote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/81404/short-description-of-an-accomplishment&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/23525/why-didnt-the-if-want-peter-wiggin&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://cooking.stackexchange.com/users?tab=voters&amp;filter=quarter" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

If the users of this site *do not* want this in general feel free to voice that opinion. We can opt out of the promotion. Individual users will be able to opt out as well (they will be provided with an &quot;I hate Hats&quot; link to opt out).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, please let us know what you think as this is your site not ours.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Majority of content blatantly stolen from [waxeagle](http://meta.christianity.stackexchange.com/users/49/wax-eagle)'s [post on meta.christianity](http://meta.christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/1420/do-you-like-hats).)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**UPDATE: I sent off the email, making it official.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - useful biking resources and websites&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be **220 x 250 pixels**&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/ads/display/778" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I think questions about bike theft - and theft prevention - are firmly on-topic, and I'll explain why: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having a bike stolen isn't like having a purse or a briefcase, since purses and briefcases aren't vehicles. But I understand your point, and a more accurate comparison would be automobile theft. Having a bike stolen isn't anything like having a car stolen, since the police in many areas don't have the time to deal with bike thieves. The decision about whether to press charges and involve insurance companies is generally only a decision when bikes are involved; auto theft generally involves these entities by default. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarly, the methods of preventing bike theft aren't anything like securing a car. You need to tote a lock with you and find a good place to lock up. There's the sliding scale of a heavy lock and high security versus the convenience of a light but less-secure lock. And, of course, you can sidestep this by getting a folding bike and carrying it with you. Quick-release wheels make theft easier, but maintenance more difficult. And so on. Few of these really have close analogies to any other kind of theft prevention. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's also an additional issue.

Turning these questions away is, essentially, turning them away from the entire Stack Exchange network. Possibly other sites could address the issues involved, but probably not as well. I'd like to see these questions answered by the experts on this site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since bike theft is a reasonably unique kind of theft, I'd like to see it remain on-topic here.

Part of the problem is that it involves a lot of legal stuff that the people answering really aren't experts in at all and are probably making bad assumptions about.

I particularly like combining an anniversary contest with bike to work month. Here are a few ideas I have:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A **Stack Exchange bike to work contest**. A lot of companies do bike to work month contests to see who can bike the farthest (or most days) each week and during the whole month. If we could implement some sort of miles/trips tracker, we could have a prize for most miles biked and most days biked during bike to work month. The winner could get a little swag package with the Bikes.SE shirt, bottle, and stickers, and perhaps a nicer additional prize like a light. This part of the contest doesn't directly improve content on the site, but I believe it benefits promotion in a couple of ways: it gets people thinking about the site, coworkers and friends may find out about the site from seeing the contest participants getting buff, etc. Also, we like fun!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - We could do a **participation or tasks** aspect to the contest, like what we had on Super User for the [Windows 8 Challenge][1]. This could be something like weekly prizes during May for most questions asked/answered or rep gained.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Cleanup and site improvement tasks**, similar to some of the contests linked above. One possible downside is that with the new review tasks, there's a lot less cleanup to be done, which lowers the viability of a cleanup-based contest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Promotion at local events** can help spread the word about the contest and the site in general. Many local bicycling advocacy groups have events during Bike to Work Month, and this is a great chance for us to spread the word about the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  - I'd specifically like to get a group together to volunteer at the May 12th **[Portland Sunday Parkways][2]**. Groups can volunteer together to [&quot;adopt&quot; an intersection][3] on the route, and will help riders and neighbors while also promoting their group. If we can get some people interested in this, we could set up a table at our adopted intersection, hand out swag and info about the site, etc. I'll create a separate meta post for that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://win8challenge.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/46103&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/434954" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Maybe a grand prize of a nice light set (a [review-winning](http://bicycles.blogoverflow.com/2012/03/tail-light-review/) Cygolite HotShot tail light and some kind of awesome headlight?)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's some contests we could imitate:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - http://meta.unix.stackexchange.com/questions/873/a-contest-to-cleanup-old-abandoned-questions&#xD;&#xA; - http://meta.security.stackexchange.com/questions/887/official-security-stack-exchange-anniversary-competition&#xD;&#xA; - http://meta.webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/1250/webapps-second-anniversary-contest&#xD;&#xA; - http://blog.superuser.com/2012/10/22/windows-8-challenge/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I particularly like combining an anniversary contest with bike to work month. Here are a few ideas I have:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A **Stack Exchange bike to work contest**. A lot of companies do bike to work month contests to see who can bike the farthest (or most days) each week and during the whole month. If we could implement some sort of miles/trips tracker, we could have a prize for most miles biked and most days biked during bike to work month. The winner could get a little swag package with the Bikes.SE shirt, bottle, and stickers, and perhaps a nicer additional prize like a light. This part of the contest doesn't directly improve content on the site, but I believe it benefits promotion in a couple of ways: it gets people thinking about the site, coworkers and friends may find out about the site from seeing the contest participants getting buff, etc. Also, we like fun!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - We could do a **participation or tasks** aspect to the contest, like what we had on Super User for the [Windows 8 Challenge][1]. This could be something like weekly prizes during May for most questions asked/answered or rep gained.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Cleanup and site improvement tasks**, similar to some of the contests linked above. One possible downside is that with the new review tasks, there's a lot less cleanup to be done, which lowers the viability of a cleanup-based contest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Promotion at local events** can help spread the word about the contest and the site in general. Many local bicycling advocacy groups have events during Bike to Work Month, and this is a great chance for us to spread the word about the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  - I'd specifically like to get a group together to volunteer at the May 12th **[Portland Sunday Parkways][2]**. Groups can volunteer together to [&quot;adopt&quot; an intersection][3] on the route, and will help riders and neighbors while also promoting their group. If we can get some people interested in this, we could set up a table at our adopted intersection, hand out swag and info about the site, etc. See the **[meta post for that event][4]**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://win8challenge.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/46103&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/434954&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/804/attention-portlanders-lets-do-sunday-parkways" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Because of that, if flag reasons are wrong, the flag may get declined, even if there's something else wrong with the post. It's helpful to pick the right flag reasons, and to use the custom text when none of the reasons is right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators (on a non-beta SE site) are here to enforce the clear community consensus. Because of that, if a post is borderline, there are no close votes and there is only one flag, we may decide not to do anything (though in that case we should mark the flag as helpful). We may simply let the flag sit for a bit to give other users a chance to vote to close or flag the post. It's better if a post is closed by several users instead of just one moderator.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have the rep to close vote, you should do that on posts you think should be closed. Some mods will even decline a flag asking for a close if the flagger has the rep to close vote and didn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Specifics of this post:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That post is about the laws around bicycling. Specifically, about a detail of the legal status of bicycles on the road. We've [decided that bicycling legal questions are on topic](http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/755/are-law-questions-ok). Therefore this question is clearly on topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your point about practical, answerable questions would be a *not constructive* close reason, not an *off topic* close reason.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That question doesn't appear to be *not constructive* to me, either. The only flaw I see is that it would be better scoped to a reasonable legal jurisdiction (country or state/province in a country), since laws are very different between countries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's definitely an *answerable* question. Either quoting the relevant laws, giving reasons for why the laws are written that way, or talking about the history behind those laws.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's not immediately obvious what the *practical* use is, but it's easy enough to imagine many. Understanding what the bicycling laws are and why they are that way can influence specific riding behavior, and is important background for anybody involved in bicycling advocacy."

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - useful biking resources and websites&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be **220 x 250 pixels**&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/ads/display/861" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It looks like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;`&lt;span&gt;Some text here&lt;/span&gt;`. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They make it so you can link to it by giving the span an ID [attribute][2], like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;`&lt;span id=&quot;section-to-link-to&quot;&gt;Article text goes here&lt;/span&gt;`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then they link to it with a link like `wikipedia.org/Article_title#section-to-link-to`. The # sign lets the browser know to look for a span* with the ID &quot;section-to-link-to&quot; on that page. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I gave this a quick try on the article that you're looking at, but Bicycles SE just ignored the HTML. (There are good reasons for this, but they're too technical to go into here.) There **may** be a way to override that, but I'm guessing the mods would need to get involved. There may also be a completely different way to do that on SE sites that I'm not aware of.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*You can actually give almost any, if not all, HTML elements an ID and this will work.

This will be an opportunity for members of the community to pose questions to the candidates on the topic of moderation.

Post answers to this question containing any questions you would like to ask the candidates. Please only post *one question per answer*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into at current.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - At the end of the phase, the Community Team will select **up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community** provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. We reserve some editorial control in the selection of the questions and may opt not to select a question that is tangential or irrelevant to moderation or the election. That said, if I have concerns about any questions in this fashion, I will be sure to point this out in comments before the decision making time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, containing 10 questions in total.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates. As a community, you are still free to, for example, hold a live chat session with your candidates to ask further questions, or perhaps clarifications from what is provided in the Q&amp;A.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have any questions or feedback about this new process, feel free to post as a comment here."

Downvote&#xD;&#xA;2. Leave a detailed comment as to why I downvoted.

Star the question. I like to keep tabs on the activity of the question so that I do not erroneously leave a downvote on an answer that might change. I think this is important and a lot of people choose to downvote and leave which can push people away especially when voters fail to leave a reason or upvote a comment that covers why they downvoted.&#xD;&#xA;4. If the answerer improves their post or if enough time has passed, I remove it from my favorites. This time varies from post to post depending on the activity on the question but usually I will leave it starred for 2 or 3 weeks to give the answerer time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind that this is the exact reason to downvote. It shouldn't be taken offensively, [StackExchange was built this way on purpose](http://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/vote-down). It should be motivation to leave good, thorough answers that can be proven _and_ improve answers that can be ameliorated. If you feel that you cannot provide this in an answer then you probably should leave it as a comment. If it is due to the way a question is asked, consider editing the question or notifying OP that the answers to their question are likely to be subjective.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the option of leaving a conflicting answer is at times a good solution but, you should only leave an answer when you're able to leave concrete facts or examples. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;One minor thing to add; many users don't visit a post again after downvoting so keep this in mind when providing an answer that's lacking proof/evidence that you might plan to provide later. &lt;/sub&gt;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Post answers to this question containing any questions you would like to ask the candidates. Please only post *one question per answer*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into at current.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - At the end of the phase, the Community Team will select **up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community** provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. We reserve some editorial control in the selection of the questions and may opt not to select a question that is tangential or irrelevant to moderation or the election. That said, if I have concerns about any questions in this fashion, I will be sure to point this out in comments before the decision making time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, containing 10 questions in total.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates. As a community, you are still free to, for example, hold a live chat session with your candidates to ask further questions, or perhaps clarifications from what is provided in the Q&amp;A.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have any questions or feedback about this new process, feel free to post as a comment here."

Moderators have their own styles, but shouldn't second-guess each other in public. Never get the author of the post involved; it's not their fault if moderators disagree, and provides unwanted fodder for unproductive conversations like &quot;well the mods can't even decide what's on topic, so why should my post be closed!&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a) What is, in your opinion as a potential future moderator, the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; biggest problem that bicycles.SE currently faces? b) If you were to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; get elected, what actions would you take towards resolving these&#xD;&#xA;&gt; issues?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the biggest issue is increasing participation. This site is a great resource, and there are some very knowledgeable participants, but it can be kind of slow sometimes. Only the first page of users can even vote to close questions, and fewer than two pages of users can edit freely. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Encouraging more voting is important, but it's also necessary to bring in new traffic. I've been very active in promoting the site already:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - In person, such as the [Stack Exchange booth at Portland Sunday Parkways][1].&#xD;&#xA; - On the Bikes.SE blog. My bike light reviews have brought in hundreds of thousands of visitors, and some of whom follow through to visit the main site and even become active users. &#xD;&#xA; - On other sites. I mention a few of my favorite Bikes.SE questions frequently when they're relevant in [/r/bicycling][2] threads on reddit, and I promote asking questions on Bike.SE from [FAQ on my Bike Lights Database site][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a moderator I will continue these activities to increase participation. I also have experience working with Stack Exchange's marketing team and community managers to organize promotional events, both online and in the physical world. I will build on these relationships to make the community's ideas for promotion come true.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sadly, I've had to deal with this several times as a Super User moderator. **The following is all from actual interactions with actual users, not hypothetical.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The key is to be polite, but firm, and to not make a public spectacle. The first step is a private mod message, emphasizing the value of their contributions, but warning them of Stack Exchange's behavior policies. In some cases the user doesn't realize they're causing a problem, and adjusts their behavior. In others, the user escalates the situation in a variety of ways. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's important to use private mod messages judiciously, and not enter into an argument. Sticking to objective facts and specific behavior that needs to change, rather than attacking the individual, is key. I generally limit myself to 2 replies asking for &quot;clarification&quot; or redemption.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In cases where the user's behavior still hasn't improved, I next discuss with the other moderators. Especially with &quot;high profile&quot; users it's important to be on the same page and have a unified plan for resolution. Sometimes a more sternly worded mod message from a second moderator emphasizes that the issue is breaking the _community_'s policies, and they're not being picked on by a single &quot;rogue moderator&quot; (their words, not mine!). If that still doesn't work, a brief suspension can be carefully considered, but does have the potential to backfire. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the very worst case scenario, a user has quit the site completely after deciding they were unable to align with the community's standards. While this is a very disappointing outcome when it happens (which is _very_ rarely), **the integrity of the community cannot be sacrificed for the answers of one user**. While I always pursue all possibilities to retain a user with valuable answers and contentious comments, the overall health of the community is paramount, and I'm not afraid to let a user go if it becomes necessary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**marked as duplicate by nhinkle♦** &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;This question has been asked before and already has an answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my _experience_, it's mostly maintenance. Handling flags, keeping an eye on the review queue, destroying spam, etc. It's also caring for the overall health and direction of the site: answering questions on meta, organizing community promotions, and keeping abreast of new developments with the Stack Exchange platform and network-wide policies. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other important thing moderators do is serve as a role model: welcoming new users by editing their posts and showing them the ropes, being courteous in comments, and advocating on behalf of the users when inter-site issues occur.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will&#xD;&#xA;&gt; do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't have many questions and answers to begin with, because I'm not the foremost expert on bike questions. I just love bikes, and I love Stack Exchange. For the questions, answers, and comments I do have, it won't make much a difference. My posts are already professional. The only difference will be carrying more authority when making comments critiquing other users, but again, I have plenty of experience with doing this tactfully and writing appropriately with a diamond.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Everybody claims that after they become a moderator they'll do the same thing they did before, just help out more with the stuff they didn't have access to. It's not entirely true &amp;ndash; I've seen it happen in dozens of moderators. You're always checking the queue and keeping an eye out for posts with problems, and it leaves less time to ask and answer. Fortunately, because I already ask and answer infrequently, you wouldn't be losing post-writing time by electing me.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more&#xD;&#xA;&gt; effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Considering there are only 6 users with &gt;10k and only one with &gt;20k, this question is a bit of a moot point for this election. I won't get to 10k on Bikes.SE any time soon, if ever, so being a moderator would make me immensely more effective. Moderation is perhaps the most effective way I can support this community, because I'm not equipped with the knowledge to answer most of the questions that come through. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On a small site like this, there also benefits to the unilateral abilities of a moderator. It can take quite a while to accumulate 5 close votes, but a moderator can close a question immediately. Moderators also have access to more nuanced tools like mod messages, suspensions, [redacted], and the ability to [redacted].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What's your take on link-only answers that get flagged for not being&#xD;&#xA;&gt; answers? Should they be removed when flagged, or are they worth&#xD;&#xA;&gt; keeping around if they answer the question?

If they didn't... Step 3: If the content behind the link could form the basis for a truly good answer that's currently not posted on the question, edit the answer into a _good_ answer with the link as a reference. Then comment and let the user know, &quot;this is how you can turn a link into a good answer. Now you know how, and can do that yourself in the future&quot;. Teach a person to fish. Step 3, alternate: If the content is crap, delete the post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Just buy a new one&quot; is kind of nuanced... if your bike got run over by a semi truck, then it's probably a valid answer (although the question, &quot;how can I fix my bike&quot; might not be valid). In general though, I don't think &quot;just buy a new one&quot; is a useful response, and I would lean towards deleting it unless the answer provides other useful insights.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Do you think bicycles has too many unanswered questions? Why not? If&#xD;&#xA;&gt; so, what would you do about it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not really. There are currently 65/4203 questions unanswered. That's 1.5%; not too shabby. More answers would be great, but there's not a _whole lot_ moderators can do about that, besides trying to recruit more members, which I've discussed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://bicycles.blogoverflow.com/2013/05/sunday-parkways-recap/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.bikelightdatabase.com/faq/" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I won't bother with making excuses, so here goes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would first contact the other moderator to find out their opinion on the matter and, conversely, express mine. Hopefully, that would clear up the issue and we could agree on whether to retract the original decision or leave it in place. If not, we would naturally bring in the other moderators and hopefully reach a consensus. Barring a consensus, my thought would be to leave the question open (regardless of whether I wanted it closed or open) so that the community could then vote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a) What is, in your opinion as a potential future moderator, the biggest problem that bicycles.SE currently faces? b) If you were to get elected, what actions would you take towards resolving these issues?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think our biggest problem right now is similar to what nhinkle said: too few members. However, I have a different take on that problem. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Right now, because of our relatively small numbers, we have a problem reaching a consensus on issues relevant to the future of the site, and even when we do reach a consensus, we have a problem enforcing it. For example, we've reached a consensus on what type of shopping questions we allow, but we regularly see shopping questions that don't fit our criteria sit open because we don't have enough people voting to close them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, I don't have the insider track that Nathan has, so I'm not sure if this is within the realm of power that a mod has, but I'd like to see either the vote thresholds lowered for smaller SE sites like ours, or the length of time that a vote remains active made longer. Lowering the threshold would be my preference between the two. I think three votes represents a consensus  for our community. And if that's too aggressive for a question or two once in a while, we can always vote to reopen. I've actually had to do that with a question I posted on AskUbuntu and it's a relatively painless process. (Incidentally, that question has been [super popular][1].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would first make the assumption that the user wasn't being intentionally argumentative/hostile/rude/whatever the problem is and that it was all unintentional. Under that assumption, I would contact the user and let them know that we had received a number of flags and illustrate that the perceived problems with his/her posts. I think that with most users, this would solve the problem. If it did not solve the problem, I would ask the other mods for their opinions on how to proceed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Delete spam. Delete lots and lots of spam. Seriously though...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of what they do, as I understand it, is getting rid of stuff that obviously doesn't fit the site, obviously off-topic questions, &quot;I'm having this problem too&quot; type answers that don't actually provide an answer, etc. They also handle the problems that users with less rep (less than 10k) bring to their attention, i.e., flags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beyond that, I really can't say it better than [A Theory of Moderation][2]: Moderators are human exception handlers.&quot; 99% of the time, the site chugs along under its own steam and the community takes care of problems. Every once in a while, something weird pops up that is so borderline that the community can't come to a consensus. This is when the moderators would have to step in (as a group, of course) and make a decision. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm fine with that. I make a conscious effort to be civil and polite in my writing style. I'm aware that my posts will be seen as more authoritative with the moderator diamond next to them, and I'm sure I've made mistakes in the past, but I also make a conscious effort to admit when I'm wrong (in life, as well as on this site), which I think would alleviate any of those errors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is probably not the right thing to say when I'm running for a moderator position, but I think I would actually be *less* effective as a mod than I would as a regular user with 10k+ rep. As I mentioned in my [nomination][3], I'm the most active reviewer on the site. I review with reckless abandon right now, comfortable in the knowledge that all of my decisions will be checked and double checked by other users and are ultimately just a drop in the bucket of community consensus. I will have to tone myself back some as a mod, leaving fringe cases open to the community. And as I mentioned above, this means that some edge cases that the community probably, but not obviously, wants closed could remain open. Soooo...yeah. Don't...vote...for...me? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But seriously, do. And then hit the review queue hard if you have the rep. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What's your take on [link-only answers](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/tags/link-only-answers/info) that get flagged for not being answers? Should they be removed when flagged, or are they worth keeping around if they answer the question? See also: http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/28/avoiding-just-buy-a-new-one-or-heres-a-link-answers&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming that the link does, in fact, answer the question, I think they should be edited into a workable answer. Preferably, someone would comment and the person who posted it would do it. Barring that, I would hope that a community member would do it. I realize that's not necessarily realistic. I would still tend to think that as long as it offers something valuable, it should be left up. If the link dies, then it's time to take it down. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Do you think bicycles has too many unanswered questions? Why not? If so, what would you do about it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nope. As nhinkle mentioned, only 1.5% of our questions are &quot;unanswered.&quot; I put that in quotes, because only 1% are actually without answers, the other 0.5% have answers without votes. Compared to a lot of SE sites (including the big dogs like Stack Overflow) that have 15-30% unanswered questions, a 99% answer rate is pretty darn good. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://askubuntu.com/questions/194651/why-use-apt-get-upgrade-instead-of-apt-get-dist-upgrade&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/election/2#post-20533" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Maybe something else?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My own approach is generally to drop hints (most likely in a comment) to guide the OP, but not to solve the problem for them. Other alternatives that spring to mind are (i) just answer the question for them and be done with it, or (ii) ignore the question on the grounds that another member will provide an answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But I'm just wondering how other people react to this type of question?"

Both are equally valid. However, we're not talking about the content of the site, we're taking about a tag used to identify content.

Maybe the comment mentioned something about the question that wasn't there any more (maybe a typo was edited out of the question), or a comment reading &quot;this question is extremely unclear&quot; when the question is perfectly clear. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are cases where a comment pointed out a problem with a questions, and the question was fixed. Do those comments have any reason at all to exist any longer? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past, I've been quite against the idea of deleting comments at all. It seems like it's important to show new users how the site works: Leave a comment about a problem, the problem will get fixed. It shows new users how the system works, it's clear, and it's transparent. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I recently came across this Q&amp;amp;A thread over on Meta Stack Overflow: &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77373/should-moderators-delete-make-correction-done-comments&quot;&gt;Should moderators delete “make correction… done” comments?&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77373/should-moderators-delete-make-correction-done-comments/77374#77374&quot;&gt;currently-most-upvoted answer&lt;/a&gt; says, in effect, that such comments should be removed, and that most users probably would be okay with that. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77373/should-moderators-delete-make-correction-done-comments/77379#77379&quot;&gt;next most popular answer&lt;/a&gt; says that we should be extremely careful, since comment deletion is, to paraphrase, completely untransparent. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What that means is that if a mod or high-rep user deletes a comment, we don't see that there's a deleted comment unless we click on the moderator menu and dig for it. So, if I go and delete a comment like &quot;Should be &lt;strong&gt;pedal&lt;/strong&gt; not &lt;strong&gt;peddle&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; after fixing the typo, it'll be more or less gone for good. If the original user didn't like that, I do have the ability to copy-paste the text and send it that user but I don't have the power to restore the comment. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to suggest that we try this out on a trial basis, being very conservative about this. How about this: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you see a comment mentioning an obvious typo, flag it for a mod and we'll delete it, but &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if it's an incredibly obvious, simple case of comment clutter. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If there's any kind of discussion going on, we'll leave things alone. If the two users involved in a discussion want it deleted, should we agree to do that? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In all cases, I'd be more comfortable with this if the request came from the original comment author. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like the title says, who's bothered by a long comment thread and would want it pruned? Who thinks it's a horrible idea and we shouldn't do it? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

An expert could always choose to go into a closed question, use comments to find out more or edit the question into something better and get the question reopened so that they can answer it, but they'd probably only do that if it's a specific topic they really care about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And to be specific: I assume you're really asking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/9248/what-is-a-complete-list-of-wheel-spoking-lacing-patterns&quot;&gt;your lacing patterns question&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As your &quot;twisted&quot; example shows, there's a nearly limitless amount of possible lacing patterns.

But there's relatively few that are really practical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;practical, answerable question based on an actual problem that you face&lt;/code&gt; would be something more like &quot;What lacing pattern should I use for this wheel?&quot; (with a good detailed description of what you're trying to accomplish).

(Since you're not citing specific examples, I'm answering this in a broad, general way. If I'm covering stuff you're very familiar with, I apologize if it comes across as lecturing or talking down; that's not my intent.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange sites are not web forums, whose job is to encourage a happy community that will come back and keep the site running through ad impressions. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh, but it's true. The purpose of a Stack Exchange Q&amp;amp;A site is not to provide a forum for people's questions, or even to help people. The purpose of Stack Exchange is to make the internet a better, more curated place, with lists of on-topic questions where the community votes the best answers to the top of the page. We want to ask and answer questions so well that when you Google &quot;How do I fix [problem] on my [type of bike]&quot;, that Stack Exchange question is the first hit on Google. Furthermore, we want to be viewed as a &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt; resource. (That last is very important.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Closing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Communities are provided with the &lt;strong&gt;close and delete mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure that questions that are off-topic, or unanswerable (i.e., can't be answered definitively and voted on) will be removed from the site. Closing a question disallows further answers, so the question can be edited. If the question is beyond saving, it can be deleted. Of course, individuals will disagree on what questions are good ones. This helps make the question more reliably answerable with answers that can be voted on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Closing is not unfriendly, nor is it malicious. Think of editing a letter: Would you want to edit a letter as the replies came in? Of course not, you'd want to edit it before it's sent out. Similarly, it's worth noting that, when borderline or problematic questions are closed &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt;, they can be edited with a freer hand than if they're left open. If they're left open, answers pile up, then it makes it harder to edit the question into a good one. &quot;What bike should I get&quot; may be edited to &quot;What features should I get in a winter commuter bike&quot;. If the more general question is answered, it's a waste of everybody's time.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Voting&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to encourage good content and discourage bad content, users are also provided with the &lt;strong&gt;upvote and downvote mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;. Upvoting good content is a way of telling the system, &quot;this person does good stuff here. We can trust them.&quot; Similarly, misinformation needs to be voted down, or the site will fill with it over time. Downvoting is a deterrent that needs to be exercised or Stack Exchange won't work. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, to the meat of this: Leaving feedback when downvoting is undeniably helpful. Downvoting someone's question or answer without explaining why leaves them to guess at why they were downvoted. It feels like a slap, getting a downvote like that. Requiring users to leave a comment while downvoting has been discussed on Meta.SO. However, filling out a comment to fill out a comment seems pointless, and it's important to preserve &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/27534/see-who-is-upvoting-downvoting-my-question-answer&quot;&gt;voter anonymity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As long as most users are leaving constructive feedback, I think we'll be fine. Drive-by downvoting is, as far as I can see, the exception and not the rule.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If the downvoting and enforcement is just the random acts of trolls...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to feel this way when you see a question closed. And I would agree that responsible downvoting and closing should be accompanied with comments explaining how the question can be improved, or it's worthless. (However, I also feel that anonymous downvoting is desirable. But that's another discussion.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you feel that &quot;enforcing&quot; is a bad thing, perhaps Stack Exchange isn't for you. This is not a feee-for-all discussion forum, it's a place meant to generate good, worthwhile, structured content that will improve the internet. People who downvote and close questions are absolutely required, and calling them &quot;trolls&quot; dismisses their contributions to the site. They are encouraging good content by taking these actions. Rather than worry about the few anonymous downvoters, simply encourage constructive feeback by listening and responding to it. And viewing closing as an opportunity to edit and re-open will result in better questions and answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Maybe the comment mentioned something about the question that wasn't there any more (maybe a typo was edited out of the question), or a comment reading &quot;this question is extremely unclear&quot; when the question is perfectly clear. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are cases where a comment pointed out a problem with a questions, and the question was fixed.

It seems like it's important to show new users how the site works: Leave a comment about a problem, the problem will get fixed. It shows new users how the system works, it's clear, and it's transparent. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I recently came across this Q&amp;A thread over on Meta Stack Overflow: [Should moderators delete “make correction… done” comments?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77373/should-moderators-delete-make-correction-done-comments) The [currently-most-upvoted answer](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77373/should-moderators-delete-make-correction-done-comments/77374#77374) says, in effect, that such comments should be removed, and that most users probably would be okay with that. The [next most popular answer](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77373/should-moderators-delete-make-correction-done-comments/77379#77379) says that we should be extremely careful, since comment deletion is, to paraphrase, completely untransparent. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What that means is that if a mod or high-rep user deletes a comment, we don't see that there's a deleted comment unless we click on the moderator menu and dig for it. So, if I go and delete a comment like &quot;Should be **pedal** not **peddle**&quot; after fixing the typo, it'll be more or less gone for good. If the original user didn't like that, I do have the ability to copy-paste the text and send it that user but I don't have the power to restore the comment. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm going to suggest that we try this out on a trial basis, being very conservative about this. How about this: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- If you see a comment mentioning an obvious typo, flag it for a mod and we'll delete it, but *only* if it's an incredibly obvious, simple case of comment clutter. &#xD;&#xA;- If there's any kind of discussion going on, we'll leave things alone. If the two users involved in a discussion want it deleted, should we agree to do that? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In all cases, I'd be more comfortable with this if the request came from the original comment author. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like the title says, who's bothered by a long comment thread and would want it pruned? Who thinks it's a horrible idea and we shouldn't do it? &#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

(Since you're not citing specific examples, I'm answering this in a broad, general way. If I'm covering stuff you're very familiar with, I apologize if it comes across as lecturing or talking down; that's not my intent.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Background&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stack Exchange sites are not web forums, whose job is to encourage a happy community that will come back and keep the site running through ad impressions. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh, but it's true. The purpose of a Stack Exchange Q&amp;A site is not to provide a forum for people's questions, or even to help people. The purpose of Stack Exchange is to make the internet a better, more curated place, with lists of on-topic questions where the community votes the best answers to the top of the page. We want to ask and answer questions so well that when you Google &quot;How do I fix [problem] on my [type of bike]&quot;, that Stack Exchange question is the first hit on Google. Furthermore, we want to be viewed as a *reliable* resource. (That last is very important.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Closing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Communities are provided with the **close and delete mechanisms** to ensure that questions that are off-topic, or unanswerable (i.e., can't be answered definitively and voted on) will be removed from the site. Closing a question disallows further answers, so the question can be edited. If the question is beyond saving, it can be deleted. Of course, individuals will disagree on what questions are good ones. This helps make the question more reliably answerable with answers that can be voted on. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Closing is not unfriendly, nor is it malicious. Think of editing a letter: Would you want to edit a letter as the replies came in? Of course not, you'd want to edit it before it's sent out. Similarly, it's worth noting that, when borderline or problematic questions are closed *quickly*, they can be edited with a freer hand than if they're left open. If they're left open, answers pile up, then it makes it harder to edit the question into a good one. &quot;What bike should I get&quot; may be edited to &quot;What features should I get in a winter commuter bike&quot;. If the more general question is answered, it's a waste of everybody's time.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Voting&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order to encourage good content and discourage bad content, users are also provided with the **upvote and downvote mechanisms**. Upvoting good content is a way of telling the system, &quot;this person does good stuff here. We can trust them.&quot; Similarly, misinformation needs to be voted down, or the site will fill with it over time. Downvoting is a deterrent that needs to be exercised or Stack Exchange won't work. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, to the meat of this: Leaving feedback when downvoting is undeniably helpful. Downvoting someone's question or answer without explaining why leaves them to guess at why they were downvoted. It feels like a slap, getting a downvote like that. Requiring users to leave a comment while downvoting has been discussed on Meta.SO. However, filling out a comment to fill out a comment seems pointless, and it's important to preserve [voter anonymity](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/27534/see-who-is-upvoting-downvoting-my-question-answer). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As long as most users are leaving constructive feedback, I think we'll be fine. Drive-by downvoting is, as far as I can see, the exception and not the rule.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Summary &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If the downvoting and enforcement is just the random acts of trolls...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's easy to feel this way when you see a question closed. And I would agree that responsible downvoting and closing should be accompanied with comments explaining how the question can be improved, or it's worthless. (However, I also feel that anonymous downvoting is desirable. But that's another discussion.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you feel that &quot;enforcing&quot; is a bad thing, perhaps Stack Exchange isn't for you. This is not a feee-for-all discussion forum, it's a place meant to generate good, worthwhile, structured content that will improve the internet. People who downvote and close questions are absolutely required, and calling them &quot;trolls&quot; dismisses their contributions to the site. They are encouraging good content by taking these actions. Rather than worry about the few anonymous downvoters, simply encourage constructive feeback by listening and responding to it.

Everyone's answer would be equally valid. (&quot;Equally valid&quot; used to be the actual phrasing of the too broad closure.) It's kind of like asking what the name for a dark brown, sweet, carbonated beverage is. Some people call it &quot;soda,&quot; others &quot;pop,&quot; in the US South it's often referred to as a &quot;Coke&quot; regardless of the actual brand, and still other people might refer to it as a &quot;sodie pop.&quot; None of these is wrong and if each were a separate answer it would be impossible to upvote and accept one of them as correct, which is the ultimate goal of the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I never changed it from &quot;primarily opinion-based&quot; to &quot;too broad&quot; for a couple of reasons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. I didn't want to step on Gary.Ray's toes. And, more importantly,&#xD;&#xA; 2. By the time I would have done so, it already had a reopen vote. If I had changed it, I would have had to reopen it and then close it again, thus invalidating the reopen vote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As it stands right now, it seems that the community has opted to reopen it. However, As noted in the blog post that I mentioned earlier, whether or not a question becomes a poll is often a function of the answers more than the question itself. If the question *does* end up becoming a poll, I would feel inclined to revisit the issue of closing it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would also like to mention that moderators are volunteers. We review questions that come to our attention and often learn as we go. Some of those questions you mention are older questions, when Stack Exchange was young, Bicycles SE was even younger, and all the moderators were fresh-faced recruits. Some of them should probably be looked at again and possibly closed or locked. Others were borderline and the answers never pushed it over the line. Sometimes we're in a hurry and might not give a question its due regard. Sometimes we're having a bad day and that might lend itself to a sterner hand. In short, we're only human. We do what we can and sometimes that results in inconsistencies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, you can always help us with inconsistencies by flagging any questions that you think don't fit the site. We look at flagged questions much more closely than random questions that pop up on the site throughout any given day. And once you hit 3000 rep, you can vote to close those questions. Ultimately, we would all prefer that questions get closed by community vote rather than by moderator intervention. We just don't have enough high rep users yet for that to always work well. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/real-questions-have-answers/" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I've been down voted far more than you, and my advice is to learn from it. People on this site are far better behaved than any online forum I've encountered previously, including the other SE sites. So assume any feedback as non-malicious and keep learning. I think it is certainly a factor that most questions and therefore most answers on the site are opinion based.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To check out answers that have scored highly in the past year, you could start with this list of [rep in the current year](http://stackexchange.com/leagues/50/year/bicycles), and look at recent high scoring answers from the top ten people. There can be varying factors for what makes for a well received answer, but overall you'll get a fair picture. Well explained, well written and supported answers get the votes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would encourage you to keep at it, and post future Meta questions also. I think it's important for the community to welcome new people who may become future leaders. On that list of rep in the current year you can see that Batman has been a member for less than a year, along with Fred the Magic Wonder Dog. So keep at it.

The answers would be community wikis dependent on the intended use of a bicycle - General advice which holds over all classes (e.g. the fit is important), commuter (e.g. if its wet weather, you probably want fenders), touring (e.g. you don't want that spiffy new road racer), downhill MTB, etc. and feature *general* things to look for when buying a bike of this type, as well as a description of bikes which fall in this region. By sending people to this question, we can give them useful advice (which holds over time), rather than just closing questions on particular bike recommendations. PeteH had a similar idea with a flowchart (in chat) but I think that would be too complicated to maintain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second would be drive train compatibility: &quot;Which drivetrain components are compatibile with which others?&quot;. Community answers would be &quot;General advice&quot;, &quot;Shimano - Road&quot;, &quot;Shimano - Mountain&quot;, &quot;SRAM - Road&quot;, &quot;SRAM - Mountain&quot;, &quot;Campy&quot;, and people can add for other drivetrains like Suntour and what not. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Eventually, I'd like to aggregate at least the &quot;What should I look for when buying a bicycle?&quot; question (which is useful for buying new or used) into a blog post on the Bicycles.SE blog if it builds up a decent number and quality of answers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/168019/big-list-of-fun-math-books" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Feel free to edit at will, especially at ellipses ..., certainly at ???&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * **Intended use** We assume that if you are into competitive sport your needs are more specialized than this general guide. The main general use categories [add more] are&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **Road - sport** Used for athletic exercise and recreation, and also racing. The bike must be well-fitted to you, and is often custom built. It will have narrow wheels and tires, drop handlebars, a high seat, &quot;clipless&quot; pedals, and no mudguards / fenders. Often used for commuting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. **Road - commuting** Used for sport, commuting, recreation. The bike needs to be a good size for you. It may have a variety of features: flat handlebars or drop bars, mudguards / fenders, pannier fixing points, pack rack(s). It could have tires 23mm wide, 25mm wide (commonly), or 28mm up to about 32mm. It must have good lights.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **Road - touring** Used for longer rides while carrying loads. Can be used for commuting and general recreation. Such a bike must be a good fit for you. It will have mudguards / fenders, stronger wheels, mounting points for panniers, a pack rack, lights.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. How many categories do we want? Hybrid, General recreation, Carrying / towing kids, MTB, Downhill, Trails, ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A few ideas on the kind of features to be mentioned ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * **Handlebars** The choices are&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **Flat bars** Many commuters use bikes with flat handlebars. A bike built to have flat handle bars will generally feel more relaxed to ride and be more stable.  &#xD;&#xA;Advantages: More relaxed upright riding position, can see more of the scenery, ...  &#xD;&#xA;Disadvantages: Only one riding position can be tiring if you ride far or try to go faster, ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. **Drop bars** More athletic commuters use bikes with drop bars (like on a racing bike). A bike built to have drop bars will generally be more sensitive to small movements and feel less stable.  &#xD;&#xA;Advantages: Five or six different hand positions allow different riding positions and improve comfort when riding further and in varying conditions, the lower body position means you can ride faster for the same effort, ...  &#xD;&#xA;Disadvantages: More stress on your body - especially your back and neck, hands can sometimes be away from the brake levers, can be harder to look behind to see traffic, ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * **Wheel sizes** See also **Tire width**. The diameter choices are&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **700c** This is a world-wide standard, common *almost* everywhere. Check that your Local Shop stocks tires and tubes in this size.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. **???** [mention MTB sizes?]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * **Tire width** On rougher roads you'll be more comfortable on wider tires. The bike frame and wheel rims must be able to accommodate the tire width. A few choices are&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **20mm** Suitable only for good roads and a &quot;racing&quot; bike.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. **23mm** A fairly narrow general use width, more suited to good roads and faster riding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **25mm** A good general use size.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. **28mm** A wider tire for rough roads and slower riding. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Tires come in widths up to 45mm. Wider tires require wider rims and larger frames. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Phew! Once you get started the list can get BIG!" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The consensus there is that what is really needed is a canonical answer. Webmasters SE provides a couple of [good examples][2] of how to implement this. I think the best way for us to do this would be a single question that covers an overview on choosing a bike (e.g., fit, benefits of old vs. new, etc.), how to choose between different styles of bikes (e.g., CX, XC, road), and then how to choose within each classification. It would be a monstrous answer for sure, but I think it would be a better catch-all than individual questions since newbies are often asking all of those questions bundled together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The drivetrain compatibility question is significantly thornier. I like the idea overall since it would be nice not to have a thousand different compatibility questions, but I think it would be too unwieldy to be realistically attainable. Even if we confined it to the more common brands (Shimano, Sram, Campy, Suntour, etc.) you practically need a flowchart to keep it all straight between companies, number of gears, road vs. mountain, etc. Throw in the odd balls (Rohloff, Sturmey-Archer, NuVinci) and it gets really hairy. And what happens when technology progresses? Electronic shifting and belt drives are sure to offer potential new realms of compatibility issues. There are rumors floating around that 12 speed drive trains in the works. And then there's the question of what to do about combos that work, but sub-optimally? It really gets dizzying and I just don't see how it can all be contained in a single question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/823/what-type-of-bike-should-i-buy/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In the interest of growing our community, I think it's best to reserve those for questions that don't fit but it's really hard to nail down something more specific.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It sounds to me like it's the &quot;become obsolete quickly&quot; part that you're really having a problem with. I get that. It really is just inaccurate. If we were going to reword anything, that's the bit I'd recommend changing. Perhaps something like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Questions seeking product, service, or learning material&#xD;&#xA;&gt; recommendations are off-topic because they tend to solicit opinionated answers, debate, and spam. Instead, describe your situation and the specific problem&#xD;&#xA;&gt; you're trying to solve.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is actually almost identical to how our grandpappy, [Stack Overflow][1], explains their rationale for keeping recommendations off topic.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - useful biking resources and websites&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be **220 x 250 pixels**&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/ads/display/968" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It happens that in this particular instance, the answer is that he can't get one and has no options. But it's easy to imagine a similar question with many options as answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What's more, information about what is and isn't available &quot;tend(s) to become obsolete quickly,&quot; which is the reason we give on our [on-off topic page][2] for closing shopping questions. In this particular case, somebody could fire up a Kickstarter campaign tomorrow, be selling these seatposts in a year, and then all the answers to this question would be dead wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In spite of all that, this question has received a fair number of views, upvotes, comments, and answers.

On the main stack, or [English](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions), most questions get a (fairly definitive) answer within *minutes*, and are also quickly pushed of the front page.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I observe an approach of *well since nobody else has answered, I'll have a go*.

Often this has the effect of triggering other answers in response.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes a short answer that *could* have been a comment is all that is required; one or two of your own answers are in this category.

Question pages with 50 or so views commonly get 4 or so votes, spread between the question and the answers. But pages with thousands of views tend to get far lower voting rates per view.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, on the one hand, the early voting tends to be quite generous, encouraging people who answer. But the later voting suggests something like *meh, (s)he's got enough votes*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the view of generous voting is also supported by the culture that we have very few downvotes, preferring to upvote other answers or leaving a comment. Looking at the voting figures for the top 50 users shows a downvote rate of about 1% or 2% of the upvotes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The mouse-over for the vote buttons says&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* This answer is useful&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* This answer is not useful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They don't say *correct* and *incorrect*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I think we tend to upvote answers that are *useful*, and downvote answers that are seen as wrong, rude/abusive or even dangerous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To answer the question - I think it's due to the small size of the user base.

Treat others as you would want to be treated. But also, we should police our own community, using our votes to show approval or otherwise of other's behavior.

Second hand sales are affected by so many factors that past sales are a poor guide. Pulling those apart to decide whether each sale was a stolen bike, a trashed bike, a bike with hidden damage or a desperate seller is usually impossible. Deciding instead to use a &quot;blue book&quot; is purely an argument from authority and invalid for all the usual reasons. Plus expressing an opinion about pricing is only meaningful when it's an observation of the interaction between a willing seller and willing buyer... exactly what the argument from authority is trying to avoid. Will the &quot;blue book&quot; people either buy or sell at the price they give? No. The end.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The trouble with &quot;benefit from current answers about specific items&quot; is that those answers will inevitably be local in both space and time. A second hand bike part is worth very different amounts in Taiwan and Qatar, for example, and in the year it's manufactured compared to 20 years after that. So they're not a good fit for this site."

Perhaps something like this simple bike path logo could be shrunk down to favicon size and still convey the right info:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found this one by doing a google image search for &quot;bike path logo&quot; - there are other similar suitable images.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/v26LU.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/h0Rtw.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

As such, we can now restart the Community Promotion Ads for 2016!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### What are Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - useful biking resources and websites&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be **300 x 250 pixels**, or double that if retina.&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of **40 KB**&#xD;&#xA; - **If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border surrounding it.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1090" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Text="It's 2016 now, and we've [made some changes to the sidebar size](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/272563/were-standardizing-the-sidebar-width-at-300px-on-all-sites). As such, we can now restart the Community Promotion Ads for 2016!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### What are Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - useful biking resources and websites&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be **300 x 250 pixels**, or double that if high DPI.&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of **150 KB**&#xD;&#xA; - **If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px (2px if high DPI) border surrounding it.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1090" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

We also have a few 14-speed questions and more 3-speed, 5-speed and even some 18-speed and 63-speed ones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I suggest removing the tag.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My feeling in general is to reject suggested new tags where there's no effort in the description, someone just thinks &quot;oh, I need at least one tag. Um. bike... no, too general&quot; so they put something random in. I've seen a rash of &quot;X applied to bikes&quot; tags added recently, and I think they're not helpful. At the very least I would prefer a longer description, and a bit more justification than &quot;you can use X in, on, or related to, a bicycle&quot;. We have &quot;carbon&quot;, &quot;bamboo&quot; and &quot;steel&quot; for example, but not &quot;plywood&quot; or &quot;plastic&quot;, and the usage of those tags is extremely erratic (there are at least 5 questions about bamboo bikes that don't use the tag, and only 4 that do).&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Rather, you should use 9 speed for a 2 x 9 or 6 speed for a 3 x 6.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason for this is that component compatibility is often based off of the thickness of the rear cogs and the spacing between them.  Your chain, cassette/freewheel, crank, chainrings, shifter, and in some cases brake options may be limited/identified by the number of gears on the rear cassette.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That means that this is a useful tag type, if curated properly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would suggest that the tag cloud for this purpose should include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Single-Speed/1 Speed&#xD;&#xA; 2. 3 speed&#xD;&#xA; 3. 5 speed&#xD;&#xA; 4. 6 speed&#xD;&#xA; 5. 7 speed&#xD;&#xA; 6. 8 speed&#xD;&#xA; 7. 9 speed&#xD;&#xA; 8. 10 speed&#xD;&#xA; 9. 11 speed&#xD;&#xA; 10. 14 speed&#xD;&#xA; 11.

Belt Drive&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; These tags would serve the purpose of separating and identifying the type of drive train on a bicycle, when necessary to answer the OP's question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, it might be wise to see if the UI for the tagging function when creating a question could be modified to show previously created tags in an organized format, with at least a rudimentary explanation of the tag or group of tag's purpose. That would, of course, require the cooperation of the SE staff and probably some time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**My suggestion would be that we keep and curate these tags, eliminating unnecessary ones (i.e. 18 speed, 21 speed, etc...) and creating the proper list as a preemptive measure.**&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In my understanding, most of them lead to the post getting onto other review queues, or to a queue for moderator attention. Flag the post when you think there's something wrong with it. Sometimes it seems worthwhile to leave a comment explaining that you're flagging the post and what the user could do about it, but only do this if the post seems salvageable. If not then don't try to discuss it with the poster, just flag it and let others deal with it.

The average is &#xD;&#xA;the distance / time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;People have perhaps been misled by the question in the title. The body of the question asks something quite different. It's a rambling discussion that ends&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I don't care about time anywhere here (minus speed) -- the definition of average speed doesn't bother me, I'm just wondering why this isn't a more widespread metric.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In retrospect, I think this question should have been flagged as *unclear what you're asking*, and closed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The current issue, as I see it, is what to do with this answer. In my view, it takes a straight forward mathematical calculation and coerces it into a statistical framework, which is then miss-applied to support the OP's thesis. In my view **it's factually incorrect**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my understanding, this site is meant to be striving to provide the best possible answers to answerable questions. The answers to some questions are a matter of opinion. Many answers cite experience. But overall we strive for the best possible answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my view a factually incorrect accepted answer should not be on a SE site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the question is - what to do. Delete the accepted answer? Get off my soap box and ignore it? Delete and close?  " ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

There's not much difference, except late answers are always ... answers, and there seems to be a higher chance of spam.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a wiki post, consider it as a draft and feel free edit at will. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The options you have are&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Upvote and approve**  &#xD;&#xA;I've been doing this more often, lately. It's a way of showing the user they're on the right track.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Downvote and approve**  &#xD;&#xA;I don't do this ever. Would others like to comment?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Skip the post**  &#xD;&#xA;Do this if you're not sure what to do with it. If you want to see what others do, you can open the post (the question title links to the question) and star it (make it a favorite). Come back to it in a day or so to see that happened. You can also click the &quot;history&quot; link to see *all* the reviews.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another reason to skip it is if you think you're not being impartial. This happens to me (andy256) sometimes when I've already answered a question and then find it on the review queue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Approve without comment**  &#xD;&#xA;Often other users have already posted comments or answers by the time you see the post on the queue. If any concerns have already been addressed then it makes sense to just approve it.  &#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, some new users just seem to get it. So much so that a nice encouraging welcome message seems out of place. If you're not leaving a nice message, consider an up vote. I (andy256) have done this more often, lately.  &#xD;&#xA;New users with 101 rep have come from another site, so they often don't need guidance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Flag the post**  &#xD;&#xA;After clicking *Flag* you get several options. In my understanding, most of them lead to the post getting onto other review queues, or to a queue for moderator attention. Flag the post when you think there's something wrong with it. Sometimes it seems worthwhile to leave a comment explaining that you're flagging the post and what the user could do about it, but only do this if the post seems salvageable. If not then don't try to discuss it with the poster, just flag it and let others deal with it. Some flag actions seem to automatically create a downvote (spam questions, for example - keep flagging them, after 6 flags they get deleted).  &#xD;&#xA;When a post should have been a comment (the newbie doesn't have enough rep to post comments) you can flag for moderator attention, and politely ask them to convert it to a comment. Leave a comment for the user to explain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Approve with a comment**  &#xD;&#xA;If you include [Bicycles.SE] in your comment it gets converted to link to the site. I like to add @username (I learned it on [English.se]) because it gives an example of how to address a user in comments (it has no effect in this case, but it is an example). Like this  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Welcome to [Bicycles.SE] @username.  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  If the user has no bronze badges, then they haven't taken the [tour](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/tour). If they do have a bronze then check if it's the [informed] badge. If they haven't taken the tour then I say something like (Móż also uses similar wording)  &#xD;&#xA;  &gt; Welcome to [Bicycles.SE] @username. We recommend that new users take the \[tour\] so that you can make best use of the site.  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  If it's a question I add at the end of that sentence&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; and since you're asking, see \[ask\].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The \[ask\] part gets converted to a link to [Help Center &gt; Asking](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask).  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  If it's an answer I add at the end of that sentence&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; and since you're answering, see \[answer\].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The \[answer\] part gets converted to a link to [Help Center &gt; Answering](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer).  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;Here are some examples of comments on first posts, and a few snippets&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Example](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/32229/8273) from dlu. This is a nice example showing positive language and a response (seemingly) written specifically for the post.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Welcome to Bicycles! You may want to spend some time on the tour to get an idea of how Stack Exchange works – we encourage answers to questions supported by evidence. The idea is that we can learn from each other's experience and knowledge. It also helps to take care with formatting and grammar in your answers. Readability counts.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* When a post is a discussion instead of a question or answer (lately I've included the \[tour\] comment mentioned above)  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Welcome to [Bicycles.SE] @username. This site is different - it's not a discussion (although you can use \[chat\]\(http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/214/the-velodrome\) for that).  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;* When an answer should be a question  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To ask your own question, start at the \[Ask Question\]\(http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/ask\) link at the top right of the Questions page, and fire away. Also check out [ask], and do a search to see if your question has already been asked and answered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* When a post is the basis for an answer, but too short (from jimirings). The post was an answer to http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/692/what-to-use-to-clean-your-chain-and-cogs&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Welcome to Bicycles SE. We're looking for answers with \[more detail\]\(http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer\). Please consider expanding your answer to explain why auto body degreaser and simple green are good solutions for the OP's problem. You might also explain why the OP wouldn't want to use auto degreaser all the time. A short, one-line answer like this is likely to get downvoted, flagged for moderator intervention, and possibly deleted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* When a post should have been a comment  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; When you have enough \[rep\]\(http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/privileges\) such a post could be made as a comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; It is a site where good answers should become definitive references. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; We're looking for answers with \[more detail\]\(http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer\).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; As this answer stands, it is likely to be downvoted and possibly deleted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; Also note that we ask that you \[be nice\]\(http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice\) on this site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is an example of a poor review: http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/32362/8273. I (andy256) saw that it had parenting content, and mildly suggested that [parenting.se] would be more appropriate. Then I couldn't help myself and added an unhelpful comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A better approach might have been to edit the question, removing all parenting references, and leaving a question that just compared DH skiing and biking. The whole interaction would have been different after that." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The number of moderators needed depends on the size of the community (and I think the system does the determination of this on its own).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you have 20k rep, you have [most of the tools][1] moderators have. Most of the extra abilities moderators have are needed very rarely. Enough users have high enough rep to not need binding votes very frequently.

There's not much difference, except late answers are always ... answers, and there seems to be a higher chance of spam.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a wiki post, consider it as a draft and feel free edit at will. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The options you have are&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Upvote and approve**  &#xD;&#xA;I've been doing this more often, lately. It's a way of showing the user they're on the right track.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Downvote and approve**  &#xD;&#xA;I don't do this ever. Would others like to comment?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Skip the post**  &#xD;&#xA;Do this if you're not sure what to do with it. If you want to see what others do, you can open the post (the question title links to the question) and star it (make it a favorite). Come back to it in a day or so to see that happened. You can also click the &quot;history&quot; link to see *all* the reviews.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another reason to skip it is if you think you're not being impartial. This happens to me (andy256) sometimes when I've already answered a question and then find it on the review queue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Approve without comment**  &#xD;&#xA;Often other users have already posted comments or answers by the time you see the post on the queue. If any concerns have already been addressed then it makes sense to just approve it.  &#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, some new users just seem to get it. So much so that a nice encouraging welcome message seems out of place. If you're not leaving a nice message, consider an up vote. I (andy256) have done this more often, lately.  &#xD;&#xA;New users with 101 rep have come from another site, so they often don't need guidance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Flag the post**  &#xD;&#xA;After clicking *Flag* you get several options. In my understanding, most of them lead to the post getting onto other review queues, or to a queue for moderator attention. Flag the post when you think there's something wrong with it. Sometimes it seems worthwhile to leave a comment explaining that you're flagging the post and what the user could do about it, but only do this if the post seems salvageable. If not then don't try to discuss it with the poster, just flag it and let others deal with it. Some flag actions seem to automatically create a downvote (spam questions, for example - keep flagging them, after 6 flags they get deleted).  &#xD;&#xA;When a post should have been a comment (the newbie doesn't have enough rep to post comments) you can flag for moderator attention, and politely ask them to convert it to a comment. Leave a comment for the user to explain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Approve with a comment**  &#xD;&#xA;If you include [Bicycles.SE] in your comment it gets converted to link to the site. I like to add @username (I learned it on [English.se]) because it gives an example of how to address a user in comments (it has no effect in this case, but it is an example).

We recommend that new users take the \[tour\] so that you can make best use of the site.  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  If it's a question I add at the end of that sentence&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; and since you're asking, see \[ask\].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The \[ask\] part gets converted to a link to [Help Center &gt; Asking](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask).  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  If it's an answer I add at the end of that sentence&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; and since you're answering, see \[answer\].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The \[answer\] part gets converted to a link to [Help Center &gt; Answering](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer).  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;Here are some examples of comments on first posts, and a few snippets&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Example](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/32229/8273) from dlu. This is a nice example showing positive language and a response (seemingly) written specifically for the post.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Welcome to Bicycles! You may want to spend some time on the tour to get an idea of how Stack Exchange works – we encourage answers to questions supported by evidence. The idea is that we can learn from each other's experience and knowledge. It also helps to take care with formatting and grammar in your answers. Readability counts.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* When a post is a discussion instead of a question or answer (lately I've included the \[tour\] comment mentioned above)  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Welcome to [Bicycles.SE] @username. This site is different - it's not a discussion (although you can use \[chat\]\(http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/214/the-velodrome\) for that).  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;* When an answer should be a question  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To ask your own question, start at the \[Ask Question\]\(http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/ask\) link at the top right of the Questions page, and fire away. Also check out [ask], and do a search to see if your question has already been asked and answered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* When a post is the basis for an answer, but too short (from jimirings). The post was an answer to http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/692/what-to-use-to-clean-your-chain-and-cogs&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Welcome to Bicycles SE. We're looking for answers with \[more detail\]\(http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer\). Please consider expanding your answer to explain why auto body degreaser and simple green are good solutions for the OP's problem. You might also explain why the OP wouldn't want to use auto degreaser all the time. A short, one-line answer like this is likely to get downvoted, flagged for moderator intervention, and possibly deleted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* When a post should have been a comment  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; When you have enough \[rep\]\(http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/privileges\) such a post could be made as a comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; It is a site where good answers should become definitive references. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; We're looking for answers with \[more detail\]\(http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer\).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; As this answer stands, it is likely to be downvoted and possibly deleted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; Also note that we ask that you \[be nice\]\(http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice\) on this site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is an example of a poor review: http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/32362/8273. I (andy256) saw that it had parenting content, and mildly suggested that [parenting.se] would be more appropriate. Then I couldn't help myself and added an unhelpful comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A better approach might have been to edit the question, removing all parenting references, and leaving a question that just compared DH skiing and biking. The whole interaction would have been different after that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And finally, a very nice [review](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/44346/how-to-bend-handlebar-to-customize-it/44389#comment93595_44389) from rclocher3:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hi Alan, and welcome to the site! We recommend all new users take [the tour](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/tour) to get the most from the site, and since you volunteered an answer, it couldn't hurt to also read [how to answer](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer). Regarding your answer, electrical conduit is meant to be bent when installed, but I'm skeptical about bending handlebars the same way; handlebars have different metallurgy, because they're meant to be light, stiff, and strong. Of course someone might try using handlebars made from conduit ;) Again, welcome." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&#xD;&#xA; - If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.bicycles.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1187" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Squatted and taken names,&#xD;&#xA;   however clever, are not helpful. You&#xD;&#xA;   can use [whois.net](http://www.whois.net/) to check&#xD;&#xA;   availability.&#xD;&#xA; - Post one domain per answer.

Please don’t think that it’s necessary to use a domain name that reflects something going wrong. We picked the name “Stack Overflow” because it has some meaning for real programmers, not because it reflected a bug or problem. “Super User” is just as good a name. I get depressed by all these suggestions of “BurntChicken.com”, “LostYarmulke.com”, and “FallenArches.com” (for former owners of McDonald’s franchises, of course).&#xD;&#xA;   2. Look for jargon that has meaning to the group of people you want to attract. Insider jargon is the duck call of insiders. Look at me! If I can say “contributory negligence,” I must be a real lawyer!&#xD;&#xA;   3. .coms are a million times better than other TLDs.&#xD;&#xA;   4. A domain name should be readable over the phone. Even on AT&amp;T Wireless. Tricky spellings are always a bad idea. Similarly, dashes reek of desperation.&#xD;&#xA;   5. Long names are not the end of the world.

Imagine the user who will never read your FAQ and you have two seconds to grab their attention. It should be catchy but descriptive. It should be thoroughly clear but painfully concise. **Make every... word... count.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are some creative examples: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Gawker](http://gawker.com/): Daily Manhattan media news and gossip. Reporting live from the center of the universe. &#xD;&#xA;- [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/): The gadget guide. So much in love with shiny new toys, it’s unnatural. &#xD;&#xA;- [Autoblog](http://www.autoblog.com/): We obsessively cover the auto industry. &#xD;&#xA;- [DumbLittleMan](http://www.dumblittleman.com/): So what do we do here? Well, it’s simple. 15 to 20 times per week we provide tips that will save you money, increase your productivity, or simply keep you sane. &#xD;&#xA;- [Needcoffee.com](http://www.needcoffee.com/): We are the Internet equivalent of a triple espresso with whipped cream. Mmmm…whipped cream. &#xD;&#xA;- [QBP](http://www.qbp.com/): QBP is the shop behind America’s bicycle shops.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Use it as a Tagline &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A shorter elevator pitch *can* be used as a tagline&amp;thinsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;thinsp;something you can display in the header at the top of the page. If it doesn't fit, consider shortening it or creating a separate tagline. Here are some great examples: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/): News for nerds. Stuff that matters. &#xD;&#xA;- [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/): Don’t live to geek, geek to live! &#xD;&#xA;- [The Simple Dollar](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/): Financial talk for the rest of us. &#xD;&#xA;- [Trek](http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/company/believe/): We believe in bikes.&#xD;&#xA;- [Bike Friday](http://www.bikefriday.com/): Performance that packs.&#xD;&#xA;- [Co-Motion Cycles](http://co-motion.com/): American made, Oregon made, handmade.&#xD;&#xA;- [League of American Bicycles](http://www.bikeleague.org/): Working for a Bicycle Friendly America.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##The Motto (don't forget your logo) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A logo begs for it own little, short tagline&amp;thinsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;thinsp;like a motto. Maybe the tagline inspires the logo; Maybe it's the other way around. Mottos make good t-shirt, bumper stickers, and other marketing material. Either way, you'll recognize a good motto when you see it: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Just do it. &#xD;&#xA;- Think Different. &#xD;&#xA;- The Uncola. &#xD;&#xA;- Intel inside. &#xD;&#xA;- Like a rock. &#xD;&#xA;- The king of beers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;hellip;and perhaps all this leads to a proper name and domain for your site&amp;hellip; *eventually*.

The best thing I can think of that will attract new members and keep current ones is to keep asking good questions. But what topics will attract people in the winter? Some ideas: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- What types of exercise can I do when cycling isn't an option? (Exercise that would keep you in reasonable shape for cycling when the &quot;season&quot; returns.) &#xD;&#xA;- I'd like to ride my road bike in the snow occasionally. Studded snow tires and fenders are overkill, but I'd like to ride my road bike in the freezing cold once in a while.&#xD;&#xA;- Can I use multiple layers of spring/fall lycra to cycle in the cold?  &#xD;&#xA;- Questions about trainers and rollers are great, we can keep asking those. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Above all, let's just keep asking good questions. When people return to cycling in March and take their bikes out of mothballs (carbon-fiber mothballs, of course), they'll come looking for answers to questions and see a community that's been keeping the flame going and is ready to answer further questions.

We should *accept that traffic's likely to be lower* until March. The majority of cyclists are fair-weather cyclists who probably don't even think about their bike through winter.&#xD;&#xA;2. We seem to have a core of people that visit the site every day or two and answer questions when they come in.  We're doing well.  I hope that this core of people continues to visit regularly through winter.&#xD;&#xA;3. We're doing well at answering questions.  There is a [single solitary unanswered question][2] on our site right now, our answer numbers round to 100% answered.  *Questions are getting answered.*&#xD;&#xA;4. There will be questions from winter cyclists, questions about related activities (winter training, winter storage, etc), questions from people that find winter a good time to rebuild their bicycles, and questions from the southern hemisphere (Australia especially).  Fewer overall, but still some.&#xD;&#xA;5. The 90 day beta evaluation time period is in 2 days.  Don't worry about it: I think we're doing well on providing solid timely answers to questions, and I think the SE team can understand that a site about cycling will have some seasonality to it and give us a few more months.  (I'd suggest we ask for pushing the final evaluation off until mid-April if the question comes up)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think what we should concentrate on is making the site work well, and prepare ourselves for increased traffic come spring:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **Vote**. Vote good answers and good questions up.  For bad ones maybe comment to give the poster a chance to improve, but vote them down when they're bad (you can always change your vote if the post changes).  The site works on an economy of reputation points that are earned through votes on good questions and answers.  The more people writing good answers get reputation points, the more there's people that can help run the site, which will be important when there's more traffic come spring, and especially important when we get out of beta.&#xD;&#xA;2. If a question can be improved, suggest or edit. (but make sure the spirit of the question is kept intact; be very careful with edits on questions)&#xD;&#xA;3. Continue answering the questions that do come in.  The better quality the answers the better off we are.&#xD;&#xA;4. If you can answer a question better, do it.  If there's several answers that could be combined into one perfect answer, give credit (with a link) to the quoted bits and write your own better answer.  If the answers are decent but you can do some research and improve on them: do it.&#xD;&#xA;5. If you have a question related to cycling, ask it on bicycles.SE.  There's some questions that make me think the questioner isn't genuinely interested in getting an answer, and in my opinion those don't tend to be as useful, since they're less likely to match up with the words in a google search for somebody with a question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some attempts at promotion to Australia, winter cycling sites, etc wouldn't hurt, though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/199/interest-over-winter/201#201&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/unanswered" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Here is a very brief summary of the discussion: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - There are many people visiting the site but people are losing interest because there are not enough questions to answer.  &#xD;&#xA; - The low hanging fruit is being picked.  Soon there will not be an extremely large amount of questions to ask.  This is different that SO since the biking technology is changing much more slowly and I think in general because questions are less complex.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that the main problem with allowing regional questions is they are usually not relevant to users from different regions.  To solve this we need some form of filtering mechanism.  Ideally having some built in method would be great but in the meantime I think we should just start using tags.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that all regional questions should be tagged with: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - tag: `regional`&#xD;&#xA; - tag: `&lt;Country&gt;` ie: `Canada`&#xD;&#xA; - tag: `&lt;Provence/State&gt;` ie: `Ontario`&#xD;&#xA; - tag: `&lt;Closest Major City&gt;` ie: `Ottawa`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some questions may not require all tags.  For example: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - *&quot;Where can I order used bike parts online in Canada?&quot;* - would only require the `regional` and `Canada` tag&#xD;&#xA; - *&quot;What is a best two day trail to do within 6 hours Ottawa?&quot;* - would require the `regional` tag, the `Canada` tag, the `Ontario` tag, and the `Quebec` tag.  (Ottawa is on the border of Quebec and Ontario so both provence tags would apply).  &#xD;&#xA; - &quot;Where can I find a 27 inch tube in Halifax?&quot; would be tagged: `regional`,`Halifax`, `Nova Scotia`, `Canada`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The logic about what questions to show users seems pretty simple too.  Seems to me: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    if(regionalTag)&#xD;&#xA;        if(userDisplayAllRegions)&#xD;&#xA;            display question in list; &#xD;&#xA;        else&#xD;&#xA;            if(countryTag == usersCountryTag)&#xD;&#xA;                if(provenceTag == usersProvenceTag)&#xD;&#xA;                    if(cityTag == usersCityTag)&#xD;&#xA;                       display question in list; &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But maybe we are not allowed to touch the code.  Regardless I think we should start allowing regional questions and start tagging them.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/184/future-questions-future-answers&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Programmers are supposed to know the first thing about what they're doing.&#xD;&#xA;2. There's a huge (and unwelcome) gap between that question and the experts reading it&#xD;&#xA;3. The question reveals a questioner who's so clueless that the task of adequately informing them is daunting (read about how to spot a &quot;[help vampire][3]&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An equivalent question on this site would be, &quot;How do you learn to ride a bike?&quot; ([however even that question isn't too basic for this site][4]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps vocabulary questions are too simple (&quot;What is *a derailleur*?&quot;); but, that's adequately/easily answered by a single 'Terminology' Q+As.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest that the existing FAQ is adequate: that a question is OK as long as ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* It's phrased as a question&#xD;&#xA;* It's about bicycles&#xD;&#xA;* It's practical; it's answerable; and it's based on an actual problem that you face&#xD;&#xA;* It's not subjective; not a disguised rant; not merely hypothetical; and not just idle curiosity&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps mods and high-rep users should readily use &quot;vote to close&quot; on questions which don't meet any/all of these criteria defined in the FAQ (on a higher-traffic sites like StackOverflow, it's easy/easier to find 5 users who are willing to close off-topic/inappropriate non-questions; there can be be 5 votes-to-close within the first minute).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally I don't think that &quot;too basic&quot; need be a criterion, because I'm guessing that, unlike with programming, and I might be wrong, a question that's a real problem but 'too basic' might have a correspondingly brief answer. Or maybe not: maybe there are some questions like, &quot;How do I build a wheel?&quot;, that would take too much explanation to answer properly?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What would you suggest as examples of answers which meet the FAQ criteria but are 'too basic'?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also suggest that for as long as Bicycles is relatively low-traffic and wants to welcome new users, you can afford to allow even basic questions, as long as the questions are 'high quality' in other ways.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not one of your expert users though, so beware; a different point of view is that [you mustn't drown out what expert-to-expert conversation there is][5] (however you interpret/perceive 'drown out').&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the subject of 'community' and 'experts': when I said above that &quot;programmers are supposed to know the first thing about what they're doing&quot; I meant that, IMO, 'professional and enthusiast programmers' ought to know about using e.g. Google to find a tutorial and/or reference to introduce the elementary use of any given programming language. If someone doesn't do that, then they are [arguably not &quot;a programmer&quot; at all as described in the first sentence of the StackOverflow FAQ][1]. In contrast, the audience for Bicycles is defined as &quot;[people who build and repair bicycles, people who train cycling, or commute on bicycles][2]&quot;: I'm not aware of questions about bicycles that could be so &quot;basic&quot; as to prove that the questioner isn't a member of *that* group. Here the FAQ allows commuters (bicycle users), as well as builders. The corresponding programming forums are split into several distinct forums (one forum for narrow coding questions, another for more subjective how-to-be-a-programmer questions, another for server administrators, another for UI designers, another for computer end-users, etc.). This forum, with a wider audience, a broader range of experience, might therefore invite a wider range of questions (including some more 'basic' questions).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://stackoverflow.com/faq&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/faq&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/452&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/258/what-does-self-support-mean-during-touring/262#262" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Should we use the tagging system to track them? Close them after a year? Keep updating them? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do we find a way to revisit likely-to-age-badly questions on a regular basis? Do we discourage the most egregious likely-to-expire questions? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(I was originally writing this up as part of my answer to [this meta question](https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276/do-we-go-shopping/278#278), but I think it's really a separate issue.) &#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Anything that sounds otherwise is really really minor details. If we go live with this design exactly like this I'd be happy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like the logo, it basically says &quot;I love bikes&quot; to me, which is a sentiment I can go for. I won't be surprised if some people don't like a heart as a logo.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The whole design is a wee bit whimsical, which I like and some won't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think maybe you were thinking of a sort of &quot;vintage&quot; thing with the texture, but it also reminds me of a road surface, which is a nice touch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the most part your design is about riding the bike, while most of our questions are about the mechanics of the bike.  The design looks more like riding on a day off than any kind of commute.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tiny nits/suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The two &quot;screenshots&quot; have a different background blue color fade going on.  Is that on purpose?  Either color scheme is fine, but I slightly prefer the shades on the question view.&#xD;&#xA;2. As [@JayBazuzi](https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/users/605/jay-bazuzi) pointed out in the comments above, the cyclist is hunched over. It would hurt less to look at that cyclist if they had a straighter back. While it is common to see cyclists hunched over like that, the preferred posture is bending at the hips and keeping your back fairly straight. (because that gives the muscles in your torso more leverage making it easier to keep weight off of your hands, because it's generally better for your back, and in some cases because it's more aerodynamic).&#xD;&#xA;3. The more I stare at the design, the more it feels like riding on an oppressively hot day where the sun beats down and there's no shade. Maybe a tree somewhere? Or a hint of some water somewhere? I get thirsty looking at the pages&#xD;&#xA;4. I like the &quot;road sign&quot; details, and was thinking having the accepted answer number highlight look like one would be nice.  I'm thinking specifically a european advisory speed limit sign (I believe Australia uses the same scheme) which is white text on a square blue background (rounded corners) with or without a thin white border, like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zeichen_380.svg or the 130 on this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zeichen_393.svg (the red circles are mandatory speed limits). (but with a blue that fits the rest of the color scheme better, of course)&#xD;&#xA;5. I kinda wish the decoration on tags made me think of bicycles in some way... Maybe something that looks a bit like the downtube company branding some manufacturers use. Most bikes the downtube branding is just straight contrasting color lettering/logos on the frame, but there's a classic style some use where that part of the tube is a different color (often with a little striping at both ends).

Congratulations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The HTML.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Why&#xD;&#xA;&gt; During the brainstorming phase, I asked myself, why do people ride bicycles if they have a choice of driving a car, or why do they choose cycling if there are other forms of exercise?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I was offered a job in a further-away office I thought, &quot;I'm either going to have to move apartments: again. Or, get a faster bike: to go the further distance.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I now commute an hour each way, by bike. It's regular exercise, because it's commuting (though I might also do it if I had the leisure).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that the motivation, of many [men](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/3335) at least, is to go fast and far.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are several categories of biking:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Road (racing, training, touring)&#xD;&#xA;* Off-road (trails)&#xD;&#xA;* Hybrid (urban, leisure, utility)&#xD;&#xA;* And others: recumbents, children, cargo, trendy bikes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Bicycles - Stack Exchange is for people who build and repair bicycles, people who train cycling, or commute on bicycles.](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/faq)&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;#Myself&#xD;&#xA;&gt; As a one-time bicycle lover myself, I thought about personal freedom, accessibility, low cost and being in touch with the great outdoors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes my first bike was the first time I left my neighbourhood alone, to go exploring. It is relatively cheap.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And the outdoors are great (I don't know how people manage 'exercise bikes' and 'trainers' indoors: I get warm and want a fan). Outside there's always as good a breeze as you're willing to cycle into.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It can be, is, easier than walking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; So for the design, I wanted to capture the feeling of riding a bike, rather than focusing on the bike as an object.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Feeling of riding a bike&#xD;&#xA;The feeling of riding a bike, for me, is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Brighter than in-doors (or darker at night and winter)&#xD;&#xA;* Balance (shoes and pedals)&#xD;&#xA;* Acceleration (setting off, little effort at low speeds, up-shifting)&#xD;&#xA;* Gliding (coasting or free-wheeling)&#xD;&#xA;* Smooth (cycling feet)&#xD;&#xA;* Faster heart and deeper breathing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reality is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* 20+ mph (32+ kph)&#xD;&#xA;* Top speed limited by wind resistance: so it's like flying&#xD;&#xA;* $1500 for a new commuting bike with accessories and free service costs less than the public transit fares for a year&#xD;&#xA;* A year-round commute is feasible: I've easily ridden in -8C through +38C (17F through 100F) temperatures for an hour each way, every weekday (except about 10 days for rain and wind and health) since March 2011, wearing basic cotton clothing and gloves (and sunscreen) etc. Winter is warm, and summer is cool (there's a breeze).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's the practical, commuting 20 km in an hour. One can cross the city about as fast on a bike as by bus and subway and tram/streetcar.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a couple of hours of cycling you can burn 1000 calories. Pre-hydrate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other people post on the forum about road bikes/races, and about off-road mountain biking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Focusing on the bike as an object&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A major purpose of the site is to Q+A about bikes as objects (here's an [interesting advertisement](http://vimeo.com/18472550)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tires. Brakes. Gloves. Bearings. Parts. Traffic skills. Maintenance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Art style&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Riding a bicycle is a very personal and independent choice. I wanted the design to reflect that. I believe a hand illustrated art style gives it a more personal touch, and the slightly vintage treatment makes it more timeless.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A poster is better than a photo which could get old.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SF is another way to make a timeless treatment (Bruce Sterling's novelette [Bicycle Repairman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_Repairman) won the Hugo).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Been around for a long time&#xD;&#xA;&gt; After all, bicycles have been around for a long time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Been around, eh?

It's better than my previous one which was new for $130 two years ago (and which is fine for an easy cycle half an hour and back: I lend it for riding to the swimming pool).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The bikes people write about are often new or used, and are usually not department store bikes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You might find modern bikes surprisingly light and fast.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Poster&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Since the design is entirely focused on a &quot;feeling,&quot; I decided to design a poster for our bicycles site first.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nice poster.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should see [Neil Fein's awesome flyer](https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/311/flyers-for-people-to-use/312#312).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; That way, I didn't have the distraction of the constraints I normally face when creating a design for the web.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Off-topic do you have a reading list to recommend? About design?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Rycp.jpg&quot;&gt;![Bicycles Poster][2]&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the picture above I'd like to see a narrower white line, to make the lanes wider. I'm glad to see you've already done that in the current design.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The above reminds me of Normandy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Above is the poster I came up with. I believe the texture, color scheme and minimalist style work towards the goal I was aiming for. From there I transfered the visual elements onto the site design.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Please keep in mind, not all of the site elements are present in these two mockups.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ads. And you're showing the header and the footer on the same fold.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I incorporated some visuals related to bicycles and cycling, e.g. road signs and cogs. But I was careful to not to make it overly &quot;themey.&quot; Also, I tried to fit all of the design in one image, so it looks busier than the live site will be.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I'm pleased with the overall design. It did capture the feel I was going after. The site has a unique identity, while maintaining the feeling of the Stack Exchange family. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; I'd love to hear your feedback. If there are no major design changes, I'm aiming to launch the site next Tuesday. So an early congrats from me!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cheers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/our-designer-in-residence-jin-yang/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Rycp.jpg" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Please chime in with any questions, concerns or improvements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Water Bottles** - Jin is working on a design that incorporates [your recommendations][1]. That design will hit the meta board for pressing last-minute input before it goes to the presses. The beautiful bottles should be available for purchase in the Stack Exchange store and free to high-rep users by the middle of September, if not earlier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Bike Contest for Victims of Theft** &#xD;&#xA; - We're still working on securing a sponsor for this campaign. It is looking increasingly likely that we will go ahead with the contest without a sponsor. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - it means we can give what we want, where we want - though it may limit our budget for near-future initiatives.&#xD;&#xA; - Location: I'm strongly considering limiting the scope of this contest to **NYC + NJ** or just the 5 boroughs. This is the first Bicycles.SE contest and I want to make sure it is a success. It will be easier to make it so if I/we focus efforts within a defined area - a city where bike theft is rampant &amp; I can get my hands greasy. If this works, the rest of the US, Canada, the UK &amp; Down Under will get a shot at winning something awesome before long.&#xD;&#xA; - I've been emailing mods in re: **a vetting process** to ensure contestants are real-life victims of bike theft. Most victims I know never filed a police report and long ago lost a receipt - if they ever got one in the first place; documentation of bike theft is a tenuous thing. **One Solution**: Require that contestants provide 10 &quot;witness&quot; upvotes. While this too can be faked, the mere opportunity to win a new bike doesn't seem worth the effort of convincing 10 friends to register &amp; vote under false pretense.&#xD;&#xA;- **Local Bike Shop (LBS) &quot;Stack Artifact&quot;** - As @Jason S [brought to our attention][2], this community could use a token to provide to fellow riders and bike shop employees that says &quot;Ask your bike questions here. Share your bike knowledge with us.&quot; Are we talking about **stickers**? I'm not sure. Maybe I'm desensitized to the novelty of stickers. Do cyclists have a use for stickers - maybe something reflective? What would you be inclined to stick on your helmet? What would you want to carry with you on an organized charity ride? What would a shopkeeper be inclined to keep in a stack next to the cash register? Think cheap, eye-catching, useful. Maybe there's something that riders can use in winter? Let's get some ideas and try to get something finalized by the end of the month. Personally, I'm looking forward to hitting up my Williamsburg bike shops with these little swaggerlicious goodies. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What ya think!?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/426/who-wants-water-bottles-who-has-a-catchy-tagline-update-new-bottle-design&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/454/should-we-be-recommending-bicycles-stackexchange-to-our-local-bike-shop-lbs" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I agree that stickers are pretty common and easy to ignore. I'm typing up few thoughts, and will assume that not everyone who reads this is familiar with bicycles. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If any of this seems like a good idea, there are threads about some of these already on the site regarding what safety equipment is most effective. Will try to dig up links and continue to add to this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Head badges**. The logo of this site is a head badge, and [there's already been a request](https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/409/vector-graphics-logo-for-laser-cutting) for the vector art so one user can cut a head badge. *(Here's [a picture of one](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=head+badge+bicycle&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=X&amp;nord=1&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=679&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;tbnid=0fekkouQZRya6M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.mytenspeeds.com/My_TenSpeeds_1/Feature_Bicycles/Feature_Bicycles_Canada/SEKINE_HISTORY/CANADIAN_SEKINE_2_Intro.htm&amp;docid=BxexhB9RhPksOM&amp;w=1042&amp;h=1363&amp;ei=48ZVTq7TDcutgQe2oK2aDA&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=453&amp;page=5&amp;tbnh=167&amp;tbnw=128&amp;start=74&amp;ndsp=17&amp;ved=1t:429,r:7,s:74&amp;tx=29&amp;ty=76).)* Perhaps a head badge would start some conversations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disadvantage: Small, not a lot of room for a logo or URL, they take some work to attach and most bikes already have one. Advantage: These are way cool and have a wow-factor.  &#xD;&#xA;- **Blinkies**. Everyone who wants to cycle at night needs one: A light at the back of the bike or on their helmet. These are cheap and made of plastic. Is there any way to brand one as a giveaway? *(Here's [a picture of a blinky](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=bicycle+blinky&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=X&amp;nord=1&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=679&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=7GIK4lCiJtqR-M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://m.twoknobbytires.com/gear-reviews/Planet-Bike-Bicycle-Lights/&amp;docid=JvAAE9fpGKnooM&amp;w=399&amp;h=329&amp;ei=_MdVTrCfAs_pgQfArumFDA&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=432&amp;page=5&amp;tbnh=160&amp;tbnw=187&amp;start=78&amp;ndsp=17&amp;ved=1t:429,r:9,s:78&amp;tx=53&amp;ty=84). There are many other kinds you can hang from your helmet or your belt or the back of a bag. There are even some you can stick in the spokes of your wheels to make you visible from the sides.)*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Disadvantage here is that these are quite small, and there's not a lot of room to print a URL. However, they are cheap - maybe $5 or $10; the expensive ones don't go uch higher than $30 until you get to the expensive super-bright rechargeable lights. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Related question: [Which is safer, head/tail lights which blink or emit a steady beam?&#xD;&#xA;](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2294/safety-data-which-is-safer-head-tail-lights-which-blink-or-emit-a-steady-beam)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Safety/high-visibility gear.** These come in the form of lightweight vests, like the ones road workers wear (some people cycle in them), or tape you can use to stick on your bike frame, or lightweight jackets for riding (getting more expensive, here - around US $50 to $100 and up for the crazy-light roadie stuff. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I particularly like the idea of Bicycles.SE safety vests, as they're inexpensive and quite visible to motorists. However, not a lot of people wear them. Maybe we can help change that? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Related question: [Safety vests: Yellow or Orange?](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/5611/safety-vests-yellow-vs-orange)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Bags.** Not larger ones like panniers or trunk bags but saddle bags or inexpensive handlebar bags, or even inexpensive backpacks.

As such, I designed this contest - with much help from the moderators &amp; not enough help from the community (my fault) - with the outside in mind:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A NYC-based Stolen Bike contest is specific &amp; catchy - I can promote it to blogs &amp; influencers&#xD;&#xA; - A vote-based contest gives participants incentive to reach out + pull in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A variety of concerns have surfaced. Some of the most pressing:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Too localized&#xD;&#xA; - Little benefit to existing &amp; high-rep users&#xD;&#xA; - Relies on back-end data (how to confirm a vote was delivered by a &quot;new user&quot;)&#xD;&#xA; - Criteria for winning vague or &quot;overwrought&quot;&#xD;&#xA; - Incentivizes creation of &quot;sock puppet&quot; users&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many of your concerns are **specific to the Stolen Bike contest**. In my mind, the criteria for winning is the biggest problem. We need a clear and concise criteria before we move on. As for &quot;too localized&quot; - I failed to adequately communicate that this was a pilot program to establish a contest model we can later take global. Despite my personal failure, this contest may indeed be too local to move forward as it is. Let me know what you think about this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other concerns - the &quot;sock puppet&quot; concern, in particular - raise issues about **upvoting contests in general**. Next week, we'll be talking at SE HQ about the viability of this type of contest, which I think is a flawed but highly effective means of bringing new users to this and other SE sites. (We'll be discussing, among other things, whether or not it is possible or even useful to allow no-rep outsiders to upvote answers posed in a specific class of &quot;contest questions.&quot;) Let me know if you have any concerns about upvoting contests or ideas about other contest models that encourage users to &quot;reach out.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the moment, the Stolen Bike Contest is on hold. I'll give you an update on where we stand at the end of next week. Until then, let the ideas flow. This is your site. Let's figure out a way to reach out that you approve.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/479/bike-contest-for-victims-of-bike-theft-the-rules" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - useful biking resources and websites&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be **220 x 250 pixels**&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/778" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I particularly like combining an anniversary contest with bike to work month. Here are a few ideas I have:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A **Stack Exchange bike to work contest**. A lot of companies do bike to work month contests to see who can bike the farthest (or most days) each week and during the whole month. If we could implement some sort of miles/trips tracker, we could have a prize for most miles biked and most days biked during bike to work month. The winner could get a little swag package with the Bikes.SE shirt, bottle, and stickers, and perhaps a nicer additional prize like a light. This part of the contest doesn't directly improve content on the site, but I believe it benefits promotion in a couple of ways: it gets people thinking about the site, coworkers and friends may find out about the site from seeing the contest participants getting buff, etc. Also, we like fun!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - We could do a **participation or tasks** aspect to the contest, like what we had on Super User for the [Windows 8 Challenge][1].

One possible downside is that with the new review tasks, there's a lot less cleanup to be done, which lowers the viability of a cleanup-based contest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Promotion at local events** can help spread the word about the contest and the site in general. Many local bicycling advocacy groups have events during Bike to Work Month, and this is a great chance for us to spread the word about the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  - I'd specifically like to get a group together to volunteer at the May 12th **[Portland Sunday Parkways][2]**. Groups can volunteer together to [&quot;adopt&quot; an intersection][3] on the route, and will help riders and neighbors while also promoting their group. If we can get some people interested in this, we could set up a table at our adopted intersection, hand out swag and info about the site, etc. See the **[meta post for that event][4]**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://win8challenge.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/46103&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/434954&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/804/attention-portlanders-lets-do-sunday-parkways" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This summer's events will be taking place once a month from May - September, with one event in each of the city's 5 quadrants*. The routes each include several city parks, which are hubs for community activities during the event. Each event often has over 20,000 participants. Overall, the 2011 Sunday Parkways had 107,300 participants across all days/locations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Parkways requires a massive number of volunteers to be successful: each intersection needs a volunteer to make sure that unauthorized vehicles don't get onto the route, and to help neighbors who live on the route get into and out of their driveways. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This year, PBOT is doing something new: [a group of people can volunteer to &quot;adopt&quot; an intersection][1] on the route.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#I want Bicycles Stack Exchange to adopt an intersection and&lt;br/&gt; promote Stack Exchange at the May 12th Sunday Parkways event!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We invite you and your organization to “own” an intersection of a Portland Sunday Parkways event.  You have the opportunity to bring your cause to life to over 20,000 event participants.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; - You make the intersection as exciting and inviting as you want. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; - You have a space for a canopy and a table.  Do what you can to entice people to hear your message as they are enjoying the open Sunday Parkways streets.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Bring along a team of volunteers, staff members, supporters and maybe a big mascot.  Cheering people on the course is fun and gets their attention.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - People love freebies.  Hand out healthy snacks. Let them make their own Sunday Parkways art.  Take their photo.  Create a reason for people to stop their bikes and engage with you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;May is National Bike to Work Month, and **we're [hoping to have an awesome site contest][2] to celebrate** and get more people interested in the site. Having a booth at the May Sunday Parkways event would be a great chance to promote the site. Here are some of the specifics:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**When and where:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Sunday, May 12th, 2013 in East Portland&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  ([Details][3]) &amp;nbsp;([Map][4])&#xD;&#xA; - The event is from 11am-4pm. If enough people sign up, we can do shifts. I'll be there for the whole day!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Who:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - I will be in Portland, and can be our contact person/coordinator&#xD;&#xA; - A few local site members have already expressed interest in helping out. I'm planning to recruit some more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What to have at our booth:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - I own a canopy and a portable table that we can probably use&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - If somebody has some sort of portable internet connection (phone/tablet with tethering, WiMax, whatever) then we can set up a laptop to show people the site. There won't be any power, but my laptop has about 8 hours of battery life, which should be plenty.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Stack Exchange swag][5]! Including Bicycles.SE t-shirts, water bottles, pens, stickers, etc! These already exist, and SE's promotion team can get us set up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Some new suggested swag items: Bicycles Stack Exchange blinky lights (something [like this][6]), reflective Stack Exchange stickers maybe?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Handouts about the site, including examples (with links!) of popular or exciting posts.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; - Some printed out larger posters with similar stuff (examples, screenshots of the site)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A banner with Bicycles' awesome site design elements plastered on it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#What I need from you:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - If you're interested in participating, please leave a comment below or ping me in chat&#xD;&#xA; - If you have ideas for what to have at our booth for promoting the site, leave an answer with your ideas&#xD;&#xA; - If you have suggestions for posts/questions to put on handouts or posters, put a list in an answer below&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;* Yes, there are **5** &lt;i&gt;quad&lt;/i&gt;rants.

Because of that, if flag reasons are wrong, the flag may get declined, even if there's something else wrong with the post. It's helpful to pick the right flag reasons, and to use the custom text when none of the reasons is right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators (on a non-beta SE site) are here to enforce the clear community consensus. Because of that, if a post is borderline, there are no close votes and there is only one flag, we may decide not to do anything (though in that case we should mark the flag as helpful). We may simply let the flag sit for a bit to give other users a chance to vote to close or flag the post. It's better if a post is closed by several users instead of just one moderator.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have the rep to close vote, you should do that on posts you think should be closed. Some mods will even decline a flag asking for a close if the flagger has the rep to close vote and didn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Specifics of this post:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That post is about the laws around bicycling. Specifically, about a detail of the legal status of bicycles on the road. We've [decided that bicycling legal questions are on topic](https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/755/are-law-questions-ok). Therefore this question is clearly on topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your point about practical, answerable questions would be a *not constructive* close reason, not an *off topic* close reason.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That question doesn't appear to be *not constructive* to me, either. The only flaw I see is that it would be better scoped to a reasonable legal jurisdiction (country or state/province in a country), since laws are very different between countries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's definitely an *answerable* question. Either quoting the relevant laws, giving reasons for why the laws are written that way, or talking about the history behind those laws.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's not immediately obvious what the *practical* use is, but it's easy enough to imagine many. Understanding what the bicycling laws are and why they are that way can influence specific riding behavior, and is important background for anybody involved in bicycling advocacy."

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - useful biking resources and websites&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be **220 x 250 pixels**&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/861" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Hopefully, that would clear up the issue and we could agree on whether to retract the original decision or leave it in place. If not, we would naturally bring in the other moderators and hopefully reach a consensus. Barring a consensus, my thought would be to leave the question open (regardless of whether I wanted it closed or open) so that the community could then vote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a) What is, in your opinion as a potential future moderator, the biggest problem that bicycles.SE currently faces? b) If you were to get elected, what actions would you take towards resolving these issues?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think our biggest problem right now is similar to what nhinkle said: too few members. However, I have a different take on that problem. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Right now, because of our relatively small numbers, we have a problem reaching a consensus on issues relevant to the future of the site, and even when we do reach a consensus, we have a problem enforcing it. For example, we've reached a consensus on what type of shopping questions we allow, but we regularly see shopping questions that don't fit our criteria sit open because we don't have enough people voting to close them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, I don't have the insider track that Nathan has, so I'm not sure if this is within the realm of power that a mod has, but I'd like to see either the vote thresholds lowered for smaller SE sites like ours, or the length of time that a vote remains active made longer. Lowering the threshold would be my preference between the two. I think three votes represents a consensus  for our community. And if that's too aggressive for a question or two once in a while, we can always vote to reopen. I've actually had to do that with a question I posted on AskUbuntu and it's a relatively painless process. (Incidentally, that question has been [super popular][1].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would first make the assumption that the user wasn't being intentionally argumentative/hostile/rude/whatever the problem is and that it was all unintentional. Under that assumption, I would contact the user and let them know that we had received a number of flags and illustrate that the perceived problems with his/her posts. I think that with most users, this would solve the problem. If it did not solve the problem, I would ask the other mods for their opinions on how to proceed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Delete spam. Delete lots and lots of spam. Seriously though...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of what they do, as I understand it, is getting rid of stuff that obviously doesn't fit the site, obviously off-topic questions, &quot;I'm having this problem too&quot; type answers that don't actually provide an answer, etc. They also handle the problems that users with less rep (less than 10k) bring to their attention, i.e., flags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beyond that, I really can't say it better than [A Theory of Moderation][2]: Moderators are human exception handlers.&quot; 99% of the time, the site chugs along under its own steam and the community takes care of problems. Every once in a while, something weird pops up that is so borderline that the community can't come to a consensus. This is when the moderators would have to step in (as a group, of course) and make a decision. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm fine with that. I make a conscious effort to be civil and polite in my writing style. I'm aware that my posts will be seen as more authoritative with the moderator diamond next to them, and I'm sure I've made mistakes in the past, but I also make a conscious effort to admit when I'm wrong (in life, as well as on this site), which I think would alleviate any of those errors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is probably not the right thing to say when I'm running for a moderator position, but I think I would actually be *less* effective as a mod than I would as a regular user with 10k+ rep. As I mentioned in my [nomination][3], I'm the most active reviewer on the site. I review with reckless abandon right now, comfortable in the knowledge that all of my decisions will be checked and double checked by other users and are ultimately just a drop in the bucket of community consensus. I will have to tone myself back some as a mod, leaving fringe cases open to the community. And as I mentioned above, this means that some edge cases that the community probably, but not obviously, wants closed could remain open. Soooo...yeah. Don't...vote...for...me? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But seriously, do. And then hit the review queue hard if you have the rep. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What's your take on [link-only answers](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/tags/link-only-answers/info) that get flagged for not being answers? Should they be removed when flagged, or are they worth keeping around if they answer the question? See also: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/28/avoiding-just-buy-a-new-one-or-heres-a-link-answers&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming that the link does, in fact, answer the question, I think they should be edited into a workable answer. Preferably, someone would comment and the person who posted it would do it. Barring that, I would hope that a community member would do it. I realize that's not necessarily realistic. I would still tend to think that as long as it offers something valuable, it should be left up. If the link dies, then it's time to take it down. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Do you think bicycles has too many unanswered questions? Why not? If so, what would you do about it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nope. As nhinkle mentioned, only 1.5% of our questions are &quot;unanswered.&quot; I put that in quotes, because only 1% are actually without answers, the other 0.5% have answers without votes. Compared to a lot of SE sites (including the big dogs like Stack Overflow) that have 15-30% unanswered questions, a 99% answer rate is pretty darn good. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://askubuntu.com/questions/194651/why-use-apt-get-upgrade-instead-of-apt-get-dist-upgrade&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/election/2#post-20533" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The consensus there is that what is really needed is a canonical answer. Webmasters SE provides a couple of [good examples][2] of how to implement this. I think the best way for us to do this would be a single question that covers an overview on choosing a bike (e.g., fit, benefits of old vs. new, etc.), how to choose between different styles of bikes (e.g., CX, XC, road), and then how to choose within each classification. It would be a monstrous answer for sure, but I think it would be a better catch-all than individual questions since newbies are often asking all of those questions bundled together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The drivetrain compatibility question is significantly thornier. I like the idea overall since it would be nice not to have a thousand different compatibility questions, but I think it would be too unwieldy to be realistically attainable. Even if we confined it to the more common brands (Shimano, Sram, Campy, Suntour, etc.) you practically need a flowchart to keep it all straight between companies, number of gears, road vs. mountain, etc. Throw in the odd balls (Rohloff, Sturmey-Archer, NuVinci) and it gets really hairy. And what happens when technology progresses? Electronic shifting and belt drives are sure to offer potential new realms of compatibility issues. There are rumors floating around that 12 speed drive trains in the works. And then there's the question of what to do about combos that work, but sub-optimally?

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - useful biking resources and websites&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*.

Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

Stop.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Assuming the question can't be edited due to insufficient detail (which is the case for at least 90% of closed subjective questions) then it goes down one of the following two tracks:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. Leave a comment warning that the question as written is likely to be closed.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. Suggest how the author could improve the question.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3.

Suggest how the author could improve the question, or appeal the decision on meta.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4.

If no one has posted a Welcome message I also go through the [First Post Review process](https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1028/8273).

On this site the reasons are not always exactly applicable, and it's common for a question to have multiple reasons for being closed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember, for spam, just flag it as spam. Don't edit, don't vote to close; those actions just give more visibility and muddy the water. When it's got 6 spam flags it will be automatically deleted." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

The voting system doesn't work right.

In other words, when you see &quot;Which jacket should I buy?&quot;, pretend they're asking how to pick a jacket for their particular needs and provide that type of information. Maybe include a few specific product recommendations with the reasons for them related to the general reasons. Even bad questions are likely to be left open if they have an awesome answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even better, edit the question into the better question that we wish they had asked.

What is X worst at?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/#comment-52087&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The problem with some of the shopping recommendations is that it is often not possible to figure out which product is better based only on data published by the manufacturer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/#comment-52092&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Shopping” or “recommendation” questions are a pox on almost every Q&amp;A community; on Gaming and RPG, it’s game-rec.

Leave a comment warning that the question as written is likely to be closed.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. Suggest how the author could improve the question.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. If the author fails to respond within a reasonable time (i.e. a few hours), actually vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The other strategy, which is the one [they] prefer, is:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. Immediately vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. Leave a comment explaining (politely!) why you voted to close.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. Suggest how the author could improve the question, or appeal the decision on meta.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. Return to the question several hours later, and if it has been closed and also edited (improved), then vote to reopen it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This would mean the pro-tem moderators would need to step in for the (flagged) subjective questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;dagger; I don't mean to pick on the poster of that question specifically, it's just a recent example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cooking.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/693/should-we-lean-more-heavily-to-editing-questions-vs-closing-them/701#701&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://cooking.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/693/should-we-lean-more-heavily-to-editing-questions-vs-closing-them&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/949/hard-data-on-price-vs-weight-closed&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://cooking.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/693/should-we-lean-more-heavily-to-editing-questions-vs-closing-them/701#701" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The voting system doesn't work right. It would be too easy to get a shopping question with page of answers with the highest voted answers being the popular choices (and earlier written choices) instead of the best solutions or best-written answers. Nobody's going to read a long list of undifferentiated answers; they don't really help anybody.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would encourage people to ignore the phrasing of the question and pretend instead that the person asked the question we wish they'd asked. In other words, when you see &quot;Which jacket should I buy?&quot;, pretend they're asking how to pick a jacket for their particular needs and provide that type of information. Maybe include a few specific product recommendations with the reasons for them related to the general reasons. Even bad questions are likely to be left open if they have an awesome answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even better, edit the question into the better question that we wish they had asked. Make sure it will still lead to answers that will help the original questioner out, and try not to invalidate any existing answers. Edits that improve questions or answers are always welcome!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Notice on that shopping question that the upvoted answers are the ones that tell you how to find a jacket or are specific about why a given choice is good, and that the actual straight product recommendations never got any votes...  But that's really because we have a good community of good answerers with a natural inclination towards awesomeness, not because the original question was very good (or good for this platform).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the comments on [Q&amp;A is Hard, Let’s Go Shopping!](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/) are pretty interesting:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/#comment-52119&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Don’t just recommend X. Explain why you recommend X.** That is:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - share your personal experiences using X&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - what characteristics of X make it better than the alternatives?&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - what other things like X have you tried?&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - what is X best at? What is X worst at?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/#comment-52087&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The problem with some of the shopping recommendations is that it is often not possible to figure out which product is better based only on data published by the manufacturer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/#comment-52092&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Shopping” or “recommendation” questions are a pox on almost every Q&amp;A community; on Gaming and RPG, it’s game-rec. On Android and Apple and Webapps, it’s app-rec. On Programmers and Stack Overflow, it’s lang-rec and framework-rec. On Photography it’s cam-rec. Those questions swamp the site and add basically NO value because the amount to 100% unverifiable opinion. Either you agree or you disagree, but no answer is ever truly right or wrong.   &#xD;&#xA;[...]   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; We had our own version of the “recommendations” questions on Seasoned Advice (cooking.SE) – recipes. We banned them right off the bat, and we are SO much better for it. Because it turns out that, even though it’s a little more effort and sometimes still kind of subjective, there ARE ways to ask those same questions without turning them into mindless polls. Of course, not surprisingly, there was that tiny minority of members who fought bitterly to allow them, but fortunately in our case, common sense prevailed and we ended up with a site that gets *interesting* questions that *enrich* our lives, at least in the kitchen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;See Also:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Gaming moved from allowing &quot;game rec&quot; questions to banning them entirely:&#xD;&#xA;  * https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/997/handling-game-recommendations-how-can-we-solve-these-two-problems-of-quality&#xD;&#xA;  * https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1438/pooling-our-resources-can-a-general-game-list-resources-question-end-this-long&#xD;&#xA;  * https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1482/final-game-rec-showdown-preparation&#xD;&#xA;  * https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1491/what-should-be-done-with-questions-asking-for-game-recommendations&#xD;&#xA;* Equivalent issues on SeasonedAdvice: https://cooking.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/728/what-types-of-recipe-questions-are-allowed/729#729&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

If you've been on any of the `.moderated` newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. *Anyone* can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question *back into review/improve mode*. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... *happen*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Why do we close a question?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on *problems you face* or things you are trying to understand. The [don't ask](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask) section of the FAQ gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions belong elsewhere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, *broadly speaking* true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Is closing like deletion?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put &quot;into improve mode&quot; if you like, and are still visible for *anyone* to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different - they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What are the requirements for closing a question?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have 3000 reputation, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option &quot;this question does not belong here&quot;. That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Why can anyone vote to close/reopen**?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Firstly, anyone can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such) because it is *your site*. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How are moderators different?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Initially, as the reputation requirement rules out many users, you will see moderators doing most of the closing to guide the site and look after the content. As you gain in reputation, you get to join in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Ok, so how does it work?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Example close button][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Close vote reasons dialog][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Other votes][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.&#xD;&#xA; * The &quot;off topic&quot; page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. On SE betas, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind.&#xD;&#xA; * The other options are straight out closes.&#xD;&#xA; * Once you pick your option and click &quot;close&quot;, your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.&#xD;&#xA; * If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.&#xD;&#xA; * Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Close banner][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How does vote to re-open work?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A closed question has a &quot;reopen&quot; link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Re-open link][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What happens if I make a mistake?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't worry! Unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**My name appears on the bottom - isn't this going to cause problems with other users?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually there are two tools for this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * [Review][6]. Here, there are a number of options for seeing things that might need say editing. One of these is a tab for all questions with close votes. You are then free to look at the question and decide if you agree.&#xD;&#xA; * [Tools][7]. Commonly referred to as the &quot;10k tools&quot;, this page let's you see even more information - certain anonymous flags, re-open votes, delete votes etc. The important one for this is the re-open page. Here, you can see questions that might have been closed incorrectly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Entire post blatantly stolen from [this meta.crypto.se answer](https://crypto.meta.stackexchange.com/a/130/1677) by [Ninefingers](https://crypto.meta.stackexchange.com/users/46/ninefingers) and barely modified at all)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3F4V.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://crypto.stackexchange.com/review&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://crypto.stackexchange.com/tools" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It's hard to answer this without specifics, but we can certainly look at these questions. There's no single best way to correct bad information in a question. Which you choose depends on the exact situation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions are looked at again from time to time, but newer questions do get more eyeballs, dou to the way these sites are designed. (In the event you'd like to ask about the design of SE sites in general, you can do that at [Meta.SO](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/).) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a few things you could try: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- When downvoting and leaving appropriate comments aren't helping, you could try raising the issue in chat. While our chatroom isn't the liveliest, I've gotten answers there to questions about how the community would prefer to handle stuff on the site. Also, **you can post in the chatroom, including an @reply in the message with someone's username** and they'll get a notification in their inbox about it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- You could start a thread here in meta, explaining your concerns. (Like you've done here.)  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- In many circumstances, the best way to correct incorrect information is to edit it yourself. You don't yet have the 1000 rep requited to edit others' posts, but you can submit edits for peer review. Respect the original author, and be certain to explain in the edit comments. If what you would have to correct would change the character of the answer, though, this may not be the best option. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- You can leave a competing answer. You can get more people to look at your answer by publicizing the question (or your answer, if you want) on Twitter and Facebook. This will, of course, have the happy side-effect of bringing more people to the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Sometimes, is't not the answer that's entirely at fault. A question can be badly phrased, and this can encourage quick, incorrect answers. You can combat this by making questions into better questions early on in the process. You can comment on the questions, submit edits to the question, or even vote to close *early*, possibly with an eye towards re-opening the question later when it's been improved. (Close votes on beta sites currently require 500 rep or higher.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- In the event that information in an answer is wrong enough to harm somebody's safety, please do bring it to the attention of the mods by flagging it. Please use this judiciously, of course! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary, there's no best way to handle this, but there are several strategies open to you. " ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

That is, get people that know bicycles and bicycling to stick around and continue providing awesome answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We close &quot;bad&quot; questions in order to not waste the time of our experts so that they continue to see the site as interesting and valuable to them. If they see that a question is closed they know it's got problems and might be a waste of their time to even look at it. An expert could always choose to go into a closed question, use comments to find out more or edit the question into something better and get the question reopened so that they can answer it, but they'd probably only do that if it's a specific topic they really care about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And to be specific: I assume you're really asking about [your lacing patterns question](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/9248/what-is-a-complete-list-of-wheel-spoking-lacing-patterns)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As your &quot;twisted&quot; example shows, there's a nearly limitless amount of possible lacing patterns.

I won't bother with making excuses, so here goes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would first contact the other moderator to find out their opinion on the matter and, conversely, express mine. Hopefully, that would clear up the issue and we could agree on whether to retract the original decision or leave it in place. If not, we would naturally bring in the other moderators and hopefully reach a consensus. Barring a consensus, my thought would be to leave the question open (regardless of whether I wanted it closed or open) so that the community could then vote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a) What is, in your opinion as a potential future moderator, the biggest problem that bicycles.SE currently faces? b) If you were to get elected, what actions would you take towards resolving these issues?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think our biggest problem right now is similar to what nhinkle said: too few members. However, I have a different take on that problem. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Right now, because of our relatively small numbers, we have a problem reaching a consensus on issues relevant to the future of the site, and even when we do reach a consensus, we have a problem enforcing it. For example, we've reached a consensus on what type of shopping questions we allow, but we regularly see shopping questions that don't fit our criteria sit open because we don't have enough people voting to close them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, I don't have the insider track that Nathan has, so I'm not sure if this is within the realm of power that a mod has, but I'd like to see either the vote thresholds lowered for smaller SE sites like ours, or the length of time that a vote remains active made longer. Lowering the threshold would be my preference between the two. I think three votes represents a consensus  for our community. And if that's too aggressive for a question or two once in a while, we can always vote to reopen. I've actually had to do that with a question I posted on AskUbuntu and it's a relatively painless process. (Incidentally, that question has been [super popular][1].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would first make the assumption that the user wasn't being intentionally argumentative/hostile/rude/whatever the problem is and that it was all unintentional. Under that assumption, I would contact the user and let them know that we had received a number of flags and illustrate that the perceived problems with his/her posts. I think that with most users, this would solve the problem. If it did not solve the problem, I would ask the other mods for their opinions on how to proceed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Delete spam. Delete lots and lots of spam. Seriously though...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of what they do, as I understand it, is getting rid of stuff that obviously doesn't fit the site, obviously off-topic questions, &quot;I'm having this problem too&quot; type answers that don't actually provide an answer, etc. They also handle the problems that users with less rep (less than 10k) bring to their attention, i.e., flags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beyond that, I really can't say it better than [A Theory of Moderation][2]: Moderators are human exception handlers.&quot; 99% of the time, the site chugs along under its own steam and the community takes care of problems. Every once in a while, something weird pops up that is so borderline that the community can't come to a consensus. This is when the moderators would have to step in (as a group, of course) and make a decision. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm fine with that. I make a conscious effort to be civil and polite in my writing style. I'm aware that my posts will be seen as more authoritative with the moderator diamond next to them, and I'm sure I've made mistakes in the past, but I also make a conscious effort to admit when I'm wrong (in life, as well as on this site), which I think would alleviate any of those errors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is probably not the right thing to say when I'm running for a moderator position, but I think I would actually be *less* effective as a mod than I would as a regular user with 10k+ rep. As I mentioned in my [nomination][3], I'm the most active reviewer on the site. I review with reckless abandon right now, comfortable in the knowledge that all of my decisions will be checked and double checked by other users and are ultimately just a drop in the bucket of community consensus. I will have to tone myself back some as a mod, leaving fringe cases open to the community. And as I mentioned above, this means that some edge cases that the community probably, but not obviously, wants closed could remain open. Soooo...yeah. Don't...vote...for...me? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But seriously, do. And then hit the review queue hard if you have the rep. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What's your take on [link-only answers](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/tags/link-only-answers/info) that get flagged for not being answers? Should they be removed when flagged, or are they worth keeping around if they answer the question? See also: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/28/avoiding-just-buy-a-new-one-or-heres-a-link-answers&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming that the link does, in fact, answer the question, I think they should be edited into a workable answer. Preferably, someone would comment and the person who posted it would do it. Barring that, I would hope that a community member would do it. I realize that's not necessarily realistic. I would still tend to think that as long as it offers something valuable, it should be left up. If the link dies, then it's time to take it down. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Do you think bicycles has too many unanswered questions? Why not? If so, what would you do about it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nope. As nhinkle mentioned, only 1.5% of our questions are &quot;unanswered.&quot; I put that in quotes, because only 1% are actually without answers, the other 0.5% have answers without votes. Compared to a lot of SE sites (including the big dogs like Stack Overflow) that have 15-30% unanswered questions, a 99% answer rate is pretty darn good. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://askubuntu.com/questions/194651/why-use-apt-get-upgrade-instead-of-apt-get-dist-upgrade&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/election/2#post-20533" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Maybe the comment mentioned something about the question that wasn't there any more (maybe a typo was edited out of the question), or a comment reading &quot;this question is extremely unclear&quot; when the question is perfectly clear. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are cases where a comment pointed out a problem with a questions, and the question was fixed.

It seems like it's important to show new users how the site works: Leave a comment about a problem, the problem will get fixed. It shows new users how the system works, it's clear, and it's transparent. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I recently came across this Q&amp;A thread over on Meta Stack Overflow: [Should moderators delete “make correction… done” comments?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77373/should-moderators-delete-make-correction-done-comments) The [currently-most-upvoted answer](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77373/should-moderators-delete-make-correction-done-comments/77374#77374) says, in effect, that such comments should be removed, and that most users probably would be okay with that. The [next most popular answer](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77373/should-moderators-delete-make-correction-done-comments/77379#77379) says that we should be extremely careful, since comment deletion is, to paraphrase, completely untransparent. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What that means is that if a mod or high-rep user deletes a comment, we don't see that there's a deleted comment unless we click on the moderator menu and dig for it. So, if I go and delete a comment like &quot;Should be **pedal** not **peddle**&quot; after fixing the typo, it'll be more or less gone for good. If the original user didn't like that, I do have the ability to copy-paste the text and send it that user but I don't have the power to restore the comment. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm going to suggest that we try this out on a trial basis, being very conservative about this. How about this: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- If you see a comment mentioning an obvious typo, flag it for a mod and we'll delete it, but *only* if it's an incredibly obvious, simple case of comment clutter. &#xD;&#xA;- If there's any kind of discussion going on, we'll leave things alone. If the two users involved in a discussion want it deleted, should we agree to do that? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In all cases, I'd be more comfortable with this if the request came from the original comment author. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like the title says, who's bothered by a long comment thread and would want it pruned?

(Since you're not citing specific examples, I'm answering this in a broad, general way. If I'm covering stuff you're very familiar with, I apologize if it comes across as lecturing or talking down; that's not my intent.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Background&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stack Exchange sites are not web forums, whose job is to encourage a happy community that will come back and keep the site running through ad impressions. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh, but it's true. The purpose of a Stack Exchange Q&amp;A site is not to provide a forum for people's questions, or even to help people. The purpose of Stack Exchange is to make the internet a better, more curated place, with lists of on-topic questions where the community votes the best answers to the top of the page. We want to ask and answer questions so well that when you Google &quot;How do I fix [problem] on my [type of bike]&quot;, that Stack Exchange question is the first hit on Google. Furthermore, we want to be viewed as a *reliable* resource. (That last is very important.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Closing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Communities are provided with the **close and delete mechanisms** to ensure that questions that are off-topic, or unanswerable (i.e., can't be answered definitively and voted on) will be removed from the site. Closing a question disallows further answers, so the question can be edited. If the question is beyond saving, it can be deleted. Of course, individuals will disagree on what questions are good ones. This helps make the question more reliably answerable with answers that can be voted on. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Closing is not unfriendly, nor is it malicious. Think of editing a letter: Would you want to edit a letter as the replies came in? Of course not, you'd want to edit it before it's sent out. Similarly, it's worth noting that, when borderline or problematic questions are closed *quickly*, they can be edited with a freer hand than if they're left open. If they're left open, answers pile up, then it makes it harder to edit the question into a good one. &quot;What bike should I get&quot; may be edited to &quot;What features should I get in a winter commuter bike&quot;. If the more general question is answered, it's a waste of everybody's time.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Voting&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order to encourage good content and discourage bad content, users are also provided with the **upvote and downvote mechanisms**. Upvoting good content is a way of telling the system, &quot;this person does good stuff here. We can trust them.&quot; Similarly, misinformation needs to be voted down, or the site will fill with it over time. Downvoting is a deterrent that needs to be exercised or Stack Exchange won't work. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, to the meat of this: Leaving feedback when downvoting is undeniably helpful. Downvoting someone's question or answer without explaining why leaves them to guess at why they were downvoted. It feels like a slap, getting a downvote like that. Requiring users to leave a comment while downvoting has been discussed on Meta.SO. However, filling out a comment to fill out a comment seems pointless, and it's important to preserve [voter anonymity](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/27534/see-who-is-upvoting-downvoting-my-question-answer). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As long as most users are leaving constructive feedback, I think we'll be fine. Drive-by downvoting is, as far as I can see, the exception and not the rule.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Summary &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If the downvoting and enforcement is just the random acts of trolls...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's easy to feel this way when you see a question closed. And I would agree that responsible downvoting and closing should be accompanied with comments explaining how the question can be improved, or it's worthless. (However, I also feel that anonymous downvoting is desirable. But that's another discussion.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you feel that &quot;enforcing&quot; is a bad thing, perhaps Stack Exchange isn't for you. This is not a feee-for-all discussion forum, it's a place meant to generate good, worthwhile, structured content that will improve the internet. People who downvote and close questions are absolutely required, and calling them &quot;trolls&quot; dismisses their contributions to the site. They are encouraging good content by taking these actions. Rather than worry about the few anonymous downvoters, simply encourage constructive feeback by listening and responding to it. And viewing closing as an opportunity to edit and re-open will result in better questions and answers. " ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

As such, we can now restart the Community Promotion Ads for 2016!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### What are Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - useful biking resources and websites&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be **300 x 250 pixels**, or double that if high DPI.&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of **150 KB**&#xD;&#xA; - **If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px (2px if high DPI) border surrounding it.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1090" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Rather than realizing that, the OP is trying to use instantaneous speed as a proxy. Looked at factors influencing instantaneous speed as being &quot;random&quot; and therefore their realized speed as a random variable drawn from a distribution of possible values, where the central tendency of the distribution represents some theoretical such as  OP's instantaneous speed in a vacuum on flat land. The OP, then went about trying to estimate this using different ways to sample instantaneous speed, then fit it distribution to it (more on that below).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In retrospect, I think this question should have been flagged as unclear what you're asking, and closed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If my interpretation is remotely correct then the original question is not clearly worded and Andy's original proposal (**closing as unclear**) would be the logical action.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;So the question is - what to do. Delete the accepted answer? Get off my soap box and ignore it? Delete and close?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think deleting the answer is the right decision as SE doesn't guarantee that an accepted answers are empirically or factually correct, only that it is suitable.  In this case because the OP accepted their own answer [there is no reputation awarded and the answer does not float to the top of the list](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5234/how-does-accepting-an-answer-work). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Statistical Aside&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The OP's statistical approach is problematic to say the least. I also think the OP is conflating (or not distinguishing) between process (i.e., riding a dirty bike one day or riding up mostly hills another day) and observation error (e.g., gps error).  The process error will cause covariance between observations and likely  sampling bias.  When estimating a PDF (probability density function) from these raw observations, most techniques will assume IID (Independent and Identically Distributed), which will not be the case.  Even if you could estimate the PDF, I am not sure what you gain as you will likely use its expected value, which is a fancy way of saying the mean value the random variable will take.&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The answers would be community wikis dependent on the intended use of a bicycle - General advice which holds over all classes (e.g. the fit is important), commuter (e.g. if its wet weather, you probably want fenders), touring (e.g. you don't want that spiffy new road racer), downhill MTB, etc. and feature *general* things to look for when buying a bike of this type, as well as a description of bikes which fall in this region. By sending people to this question, we can give them useful advice (which holds over time), rather than just closing questions on particular bike recommendations. PeteH had a similar idea with a flowchart (in chat) but I think that would be too complicated to maintain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second would be drive train compatibility: &quot;Which drivetrain components are compatibile with which others?&quot;. Community answers would be &quot;General advice&quot;, &quot;Shimano - Road&quot;, &quot;Shimano - Mountain&quot;, &quot;SRAM - Road&quot;, &quot;SRAM - Mountain&quot;, &quot;Campy&quot;, and people can add for other drivetrains like Suntour and what not. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Eventually, I'd like to aggregate at least the &quot;What should I look for when buying a bicycle?&quot; question (which is useful for buying new or used) into a blog post on the Bicycles.SE blog if it builds up a decent number and quality of answers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/168019/big-list-of-fun-math-books" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I won't bother with making excuses, so here goes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would first contact the other moderator to find out their opinion on the matter and, conversely, express mine. Hopefully, that would clear up the issue and we could agree on whether to retract the original decision or leave it in place. If not, we would naturally bring in the other moderators and hopefully reach a consensus. Barring a consensus, my thought would be to leave the question open (regardless of whether I wanted it closed or open) so that the community could then vote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a) What is, in your opinion as a potential future moderator, the biggest problem that bicycles.SE currently faces? b) If you were to get elected, what actions would you take towards resolving these issues?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think our biggest problem right now is similar to what nhinkle said: too few members. However, I have a different take on that problem. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Right now, because of our relatively small numbers, we have a problem reaching a consensus on issues relevant to the future of the site, and even when we do reach a consensus, we have a problem enforcing it. For example, we've reached a consensus on what type of shopping questions we allow, but we regularly see shopping questions that don't fit our criteria sit open because we don't have enough people voting to close them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, I don't have the insider track that Nathan has, so I'm not sure if this is within the realm of power that a mod has, but I'd like to see either the vote thresholds lowered for smaller SE sites like ours, or the length of time that a vote remains active made longer. Lowering the threshold would be my preference between the two. I think three votes represents a consensus  for our community. And if that's too aggressive for a question or two once in a while, we can always vote to reopen. I've actually had to do that with a question I posted on AskUbuntu and it's a relatively painless process. (Incidentally, that question has been [super popular][1].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would first make the assumption that the user wasn't being intentionally argumentative/hostile/rude/whatever the problem is and that it was all unintentional. Under that assumption, I would contact the user and let them know that we had received a number of flags and illustrate that the perceived problems with his/her posts. I think that with most users, this would solve the problem. If it did not solve the problem, I would ask the other mods for their opinions on how to proceed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Delete spam. Delete lots and lots of spam. Seriously though...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of what they do, as I understand it, is getting rid of stuff that obviously doesn't fit the site, obviously off-topic questions, &quot;I'm having this problem too&quot; type answers that don't actually provide an answer, etc. They also handle the problems that users with less rep (less than 10k) bring to their attention, i.e., flags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beyond that, I really can't say it better than [A Theory of Moderation][2]: Moderators are human exception handlers.&quot; 99% of the time, the site chugs along under its own steam and the community takes care of problems. Every once in a while, something weird pops up that is so borderline that the community can't come to a consensus. This is when the moderators would have to step in (as a group, of course) and make a decision. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm fine with that. I make a conscious effort to be civil and polite in my writing style. I'm aware that my posts will be seen as more authoritative with the moderator diamond next to them, and I'm sure I've made mistakes in the past, but I also make a conscious effort to admit when I'm wrong (in life, as well as on this site), which I think would alleviate any of those errors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is probably not the right thing to say when I'm running for a moderator position, but I think I would actually be *less* effective as a mod than I would as a regular user with 10k+ rep. As I mentioned in my [nomination][3], I'm the most active reviewer on the site. I review with reckless abandon right now, comfortable in the knowledge that all of my decisions will be checked and double checked by other users and are ultimately just a drop in the bucket of community consensus. I will have to tone myself back some as a mod, leaving fringe cases open to the community. And as I mentioned above, this means that some edge cases that the community probably, but not obviously, wants closed could remain open. Soooo...yeah. Don't...vote...for...me? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But seriously, do. And then hit the review queue hard if you have the rep. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What's your take on [link-only answers](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/tags/link-only-answers/info) that get flagged for not being answers? Should they be removed when flagged, or are they worth keeping around if they answer the question? See also: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/28/avoiding-just-buy-a-new-one-or-heres-a-link-answers&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming that the link does, in fact, answer the question, I think they should be edited into a workable answer. Preferably, someone would comment and the person who posted it would do it. Barring that, I would hope that a community member would do it. I realize that's not necessarily realistic. I would still tend to think that as long as it offers something valuable, it should be left up. If the link dies, then it's time to take it down. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Do you think bicycles has too many unanswered questions? Why not? If so, what would you do about it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nope. As nhinkle mentioned, only 1.5% of our questions are &quot;unanswered.&quot; I put that in quotes, because only 1% are actually without answers, the other 0.5% have answers without votes. Compared to a lot of SE sites (including the big dogs like Stack Overflow) that have 15-30% unanswered questions, a 99% answer rate is pretty darn good. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://askubuntu.com/questions/194651/why-use-apt-get-upgrade-instead-of-apt-get-dist-upgrade&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/election/2#post-20533" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Once the system learns to trust you, you'll be able to edit anything, much like Wikipedia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This isn't a site to discuss things, this is a site where you can ask questions that have (ideally) a single answer, or at least a single best answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our goal is to become the go-to internet location for expert answers to objective questions. This requirement that questions be objective helps maintain the quality and expert appeal of our site. You won't ever have to dig through tons of questions like &quot;what bike should I get ...&quot; that are better suited for the discussion format of boards like this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few examples of the questions that have been asked and answered on our site:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- What considerations are important when purchasing a new chain?&#xD;&#xA;- Are there any recumbent tricycles that can be transported with a normal car?&#xD;&#xA;- What can I do to keep my rear dérailleur in good condition when commuting in the snow?&#xD;&#xA;- How do I prevent disk brakes from squeaking in the rain?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please stop by and check us out. It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or an experienced cyclist, you are most certainly welcome. We want the community to expand! We need people to ask and answer the most basic of questions as well as the most advanced, esoteric questions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We look forward to seeing new faces!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Huh? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm told that the question is more suited to forums. Ok. Then why the question regarding for/against bike helmets? That question was apparently carefully phrased to pass muster. Yet, since reading and participating in usenet forums since the '90's, I've seen dozens of various incarnations of _that_ question.

Don't worry about it: I think we're doing well on providing solid timely answers to questions, and I think the SE team can understand that a site about cycling will have some seasonality to it and give us a few more months.  (I'd suggest we ask for pushing the final evaluation off until mid-April if the question comes up)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think what we should concentrate on is making the site work well, and prepare ourselves for increased traffic come spring:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **Vote**. Vote good answers and good questions up.  For bad ones maybe comment to give the poster a chance to improve, but vote them down when they're bad (you can always change your vote if the post changes).  The site works on an economy of reputation points that are earned through votes on good questions and answers.  The more people writing good answers get reputation points, the more there's people that can help run the site, which will be important when there's more traffic come spring, and especially important when we get out of beta.&#xD;&#xA;2. If a question can be improved, suggest or edit. (but make sure the spirit of the question is kept intact; be very careful with edits on questions)&#xD;&#xA;3. Continue answering the questions that do come in.  The better quality the answers the better off we are.&#xD;&#xA;4. If you can answer a question better, do it.  If there's several answers that could be combined into one perfect answer, give credit (with a link) to the quoted bits and write your own better answer.  If the answers are decent but you can do some research and improve on them: do it.&#xD;&#xA;5. If you have a question related to cycling, ask it on bicycles.SE.  There's some questions that make me think the questioner isn't genuinely interested in getting an answer, and in my opinion those don't tend to be as useful, since they're less likely to match up with the words in a google search for somebody with a question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some attempts at promotion to Australia, winter cycling sites, etc wouldn't hurt, though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/199/interest-over-winter/201#201&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/unanswered" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

If the author fails to respond within a reasonable time (i.e. a few hours), actually vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The other strategy, which is the one [they] prefer, is:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. Immediately vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. Leave a comment explaining (politely!) why you voted to close.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. Suggest how the author could improve the question, or appeal the decision on meta.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. Return to the question several hours later, and if it has been closed and also edited (improved), then vote to reopen it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This would mean the pro-tem moderators would need to step in for the (flagged) subjective questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;dagger; I don't mean to pick on the poster of that question specifically, it's just a recent example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cooking.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/693/should-we-lean-more-heavily-to-editing-questions-vs-closing-them/701#701&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://cooking.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/693/should-we-lean-more-heavily-to-editing-questions-vs-closing-them&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/949/hard-data-on-price-vs-weight-closed&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://cooking.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/693/should-we-lean-more-heavily-to-editing-questions-vs-closing-them/701#701" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

He had swelling and severe pain, and went so far as to take 6 months off from riding. There is no indication that he saw a physician.

The poster in question accepted an answer that is essentially good; however, the answer primarily focuses on ITBS and stretches for that. If the poster does have ITBS, ok. But what if he actually has a lateral meniscus tear? Or one of a few other possibile injuries? The stretches and exercises recommended could make it worse, leading to surgery or maybe he already needs surgery. Or maybe the poster accepted the advice in the accepted answer to see a physician? Who knows?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a huge difference between the road rash question and the knee pain question. With the road rash, the cyclist received medical attention, had an accurate diagnosis and was seeking additional information/tips. The knee pain question is about an undiagnosed internal injury.

The question [Arguments for/against bike lanes?](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/1800/8) shows, with a slightly less-volatile issue than the helmet debate, that this community is extremely capable of generating good answers to difficult questions.

The question reveals a questioner who's so clueless that the task of adequately informing them is daunting (read about how to spot a &quot;[help vampire][3]&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An equivalent question on this site would be, &quot;How do you learn to ride a bike?&quot; ([however even that question isn't too basic for this site][4]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps vocabulary questions are too simple (&quot;What is *a derailleur*?&quot;); but, that's adequately/easily answered by a single 'Terminology' Q+As.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest that the existing FAQ is adequate: that a question is OK as long as ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* It's phrased as a question&#xD;&#xA;* It's about bicycles&#xD;&#xA;* It's practical; it's answerable; and it's based on an actual problem that you face&#xD;&#xA;* It's not subjective; not a disguised rant; not merely hypothetical; and not just idle curiosity&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps mods and high-rep users should readily use &quot;vote to close&quot; on questions which don't meet any/all of these criteria defined in the FAQ (on a higher-traffic sites like StackOverflow, it's easy/easier to find 5 users who are willing to close off-topic/inappropriate non-questions; there can be be 5 votes-to-close within the first minute).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally I don't think that &quot;too basic&quot; need be a criterion, because I'm guessing that, unlike with programming, and I might be wrong, a question that's a real problem but 'too basic' might have a correspondingly brief answer. Or maybe not: maybe there are some questions like, &quot;How do I build a wheel?&quot;, that would take too much explanation to answer properly?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What would you suggest as examples of answers which meet the FAQ criteria but are 'too basic'?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also suggest that for as long as Bicycles is relatively low-traffic and wants to welcome new users, you can afford to allow even basic questions, as long as the questions are 'high quality' in other ways.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not one of your expert users though, so beware; a different point of view is that [you mustn't drown out what expert-to-expert conversation there is][5] (however you interpret/perceive 'drown out').&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the subject of 'community' and 'experts': when I said above that &quot;programmers are supposed to know the first thing about what they're doing&quot; I meant that, IMO, 'professional and enthusiast programmers' ought to know about using e.g. Google to find a tutorial and/or reference to introduce the elementary use of any given programming language. If someone doesn't do that, then they are [arguably not &quot;a programmer&quot; at all as described in the first sentence of the StackOverflow FAQ][1]. In contrast, the audience for Bicycles is defined as &quot;[people who build and repair bicycles, people who train cycling, or commute on bicycles][2]&quot;: I'm not aware of questions about bicycles that could be so &quot;basic&quot; as to prove that the questioner isn't a member of *that* group. Here the FAQ allows commuters (bicycle users), as well as builders. The corresponding programming forums are split into several distinct forums (one forum for narrow coding questions, another for more subjective how-to-be-a-programmer questions, another for server administrators, another for UI designers, another for computer end-users, etc.). This forum, with a wider audience, a broader range of experience, might therefore invite a wider range of questions (including some more 'basic' questions).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://stackoverflow.com/faq&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/faq&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/452&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/258/what-does-self-support-mean-during-touring/262#262" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Cycling has a certain amount of regionality inherent to it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm unable to think of any clear hard-and-fast rules for dealing with regional questions, and can only think of rough guidelines. What's too small a geographic area? Ultimately it's going to be a judgement call whether or not the question is likely `to ever help any future visitors`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By &quot;too localized&quot; I mean something like the close reason in [our faq](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/faq#close):&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * **too localized**  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; This question is unlikely to ever help any future visitors; it is only relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily &#xD;&#xA;narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that the &quot;too localized&quot; criteria aren't strictly about geographic area. I'm thinking of geographic area as just one way that questions have too narrow a scope. If it's about a topic that affects everybody in a relatively small area and we have a lot of users in that area, that's very different than if it's a relatively obscure topic in that same geographic area.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also seems to me like some of the &quot;bad&quot; regional questions are only part too-localized. They often seem also subjective and/or poll-style. [Bicycle tours in Athens](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/1913/bike-tours-in-athens-greece) isn't just a small geographic area, it's a poll for subjective answers, it's probably only relevant to a small number of the local cyclists, I don't think we have enough local experts to evaluate answers, and it's difficult to do any objective research without having been there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, [helmets laws in australia and new zealand](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2211/should-i-be-concerned-about-new-helmet-laws) is a bigger geographic area, more objectively answerable, affects every cyclist in those countries, and is possible to research on the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps one of the criteria for too-localized should be if the question sits unanswered too long."

Congratulations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The HTML.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Why&#xD;&#xA;&gt; During the brainstorming phase, I asked myself, why do people ride bicycles if they have a choice of driving a car, or why do they choose cycling if there are other forms of exercise?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I was offered a job in a further-away office I thought, &quot;I'm either going to have to move apartments: again. Or, get a faster bike: to go the further distance.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I now commute an hour each way, by bike. It's regular exercise, because it's commuting (though I might also do it if I had the leisure).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that the motivation, of many [men](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/3335) at least, is to go fast and far.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are several categories of biking:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Road (racing, training, touring)&#xD;&#xA;* Off-road (trails)&#xD;&#xA;* Hybrid (urban, leisure, utility)&#xD;&#xA;* And others: recumbents, children, cargo, trendy bikes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Bicycles - Stack Exchange is for people who build and repair bicycles, people who train cycling, or commute on bicycles.](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/faq)&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;#Myself&#xD;&#xA;&gt; As a one-time bicycle lover myself, I thought about personal freedom, accessibility, low cost and being in touch with the great outdoors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes my first bike was the first time I left my neighbourhood alone, to go exploring. It is relatively cheap.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And the outdoors are great (I don't know how people manage 'exercise bikes' and 'trainers' indoors: I get warm and want a fan). Outside there's always as good a breeze as you're willing to cycle into.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It can be, is, easier than walking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; So for the design, I wanted to capture the feeling of riding a bike, rather than focusing on the bike as an object.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Feeling of riding a bike&#xD;&#xA;The feeling of riding a bike, for me, is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Brighter than in-doors (or darker at night and winter)&#xD;&#xA;* Balance (shoes and pedals)&#xD;&#xA;* Acceleration (setting off, little effort at low speeds, up-shifting)&#xD;&#xA;* Gliding (coasting or free-wheeling)&#xD;&#xA;* Smooth (cycling feet)&#xD;&#xA;* Faster heart and deeper breathing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reality is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* 20+ mph (32+ kph)&#xD;&#xA;* Top speed limited by wind resistance: so it's like flying&#xD;&#xA;* $1500 for a new commuting bike with accessories and free service costs less than the public transit fares for a year&#xD;&#xA;* A year-round commute is feasible: I've easily ridden in -8C through +38C (17F through 100F) temperatures for an hour each way, every weekday (except about 10 days for rain and wind and health) since March 2011, wearing basic cotton clothing and gloves (and sunscreen) etc. Winter is warm, and summer is cool (there's a breeze).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's the practical, commuting 20 km in an hour. One can cross the city about as fast on a bike as by bus and subway and tram/streetcar.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a couple of hours of cycling you can burn 1000 calories. Pre-hydrate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other people post on the forum about road bikes/races, and about off-road mountain biking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Focusing on the bike as an object&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A major purpose of the site is to Q+A about bikes as objects (here's an [interesting advertisement](http://vimeo.com/18472550)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tires. Brakes. Gloves. Bearings. Parts. Traffic skills. Maintenance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Art style&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Riding a bicycle is a very personal and independent choice. I wanted the design to reflect that. I believe a hand illustrated art style gives it a more personal touch, and the slightly vintage treatment makes it more timeless.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A poster is better than a photo which could get old.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SF is another way to make a timeless treatment (Bruce Sterling's novelette [Bicycle Repairman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_Repairman) won the Hugo).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Been around for a long time&#xD;&#xA;&gt; After all, bicycles have been around for a long time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Been around, eh? Know what I mean?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mine's fairly new, and maintained. It's better than my previous one which was new for $130 two years ago (and which is fine for an easy cycle half an hour and back: I lend it for riding to the swimming pool).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The bikes people write about are often new or used, and are usually not department store bikes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You might find modern bikes surprisingly light and fast.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Poster&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Since the design is entirely focused on a &quot;feeling,&quot; I decided to design a poster for our bicycles site first.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nice poster.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should see [Neil Fein's awesome flyer](https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/311/flyers-for-people-to-use/312#312).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; That way, I didn't have the distraction of the constraints I normally face when creating a design for the web.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Off-topic do you have a reading list to recommend? About design?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Rycp.jpg&quot;&gt;![Bicycles Poster][2]&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the picture above I'd like to see a narrower white line, to make the lanes wider. I'm glad to see you've already done that in the current design.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The above reminds me of Normandy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Above is the poster I came up with. I believe the texture, color scheme and minimalist style work towards the goal I was aiming for. From there I transfered the visual elements onto the site design.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Please keep in mind, not all of the site elements are present in these two mockups.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ads. And you're showing the header and the footer on the same fold.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I incorporated some visuals related to bicycles and cycling, e.g. road signs and cogs. But I was careful to not to make it overly &quot;themey.&quot; Also, I tried to fit all of the design in one image, so it looks busier than the live site will be.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I'm pleased with the overall design. It did capture the feel I was going after. The site has a unique identity, while maintaining the feeling of the Stack Exchange family. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; I'd love to hear your feedback. If there are no major design changes, I'm aiming to launch the site next Tuesday. So an early congrats from me!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cheers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/our-designer-in-residence-jin-yang/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Rycp.jpg" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

And the idea of a sponsored question sounds like it could create a conflict of interest. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Why easy questions are bad for the site**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions that are easy to answer by anyone are, by definition, bad questions because Stack Exchange is designed to produce good answers. Unless I'm missing the point here, it sounds like you want to ask some sponsored questions that will be easy to answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Attracting new users to the site means bringing volumes of them here. The Stack Exchange system is set up to actively discourage users who don't want to work in the Q&amp;A format, leaving only the ones who will generate good content. These two obviously work at cross purposes, and I don't envy anyone the task of getting new users here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On Stack Exchange, good information will be easy to find; as the good answers are upvoted, they'll rise to the top of the page. **Writing good questions and answers is supposed to be a difficult thing, not an easy one.** New users - and getting them here is the point of this exercise - will see a question like this and assume it's representative of the site.  **Allowing questions that are easy to answer because they're sponsored would be watering down the site.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The cycle accessory question you link to would almost certainly be closed were it asked today. It's a chatty question that serves no real purpose. What do the upvotes mean on those answers? That someone liked these accessories? That the upvoters agree with the answers? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarly, introducing a Q&amp;A thread that's easy to participate in would defeat the purpose of the site. We want questions that produce answers by experts. If there are many answers possible, then, a few [glossary](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/glossary) community wiki questions to the side, such a question isn't a very good one or it isn't being asked properly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sponsored questions and conflicts of interest**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's say that a way can be found to get past all of that. Well and good. If, say, Tektro wanted to sponsor a question about brake levers, would mods be bound to keep it open? What about users who feel that they make horrible components? (Personally, I love my Tektro brakes, but I digress.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Would users be bound to avoid [sharing their extensive knowledge](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/6286/do-cyclocross-interrupter-touring-brake-levers-reduce-brake-performance/6310#6310) if it's bad for the sponsor? Are we stuck with a sponsored question if it's a bad question? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Suggestions**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similar to how blog functionality was introduced with Blog Overflow, and moderator elections are carried out on a dedicated election page, perhaps a new functionality for contests can be created. This not only wouldn't compromise the site but it would allow for greater flexibility in building the perfect promotional/contest engine.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While most efforts to find new ways to use the Q&amp;A format seem to end fairly badly, some do not. Witness the glossary (which originated, as far as I know, on Cooking) and the citation-heavy format on Skeptics. Perhaps I'm missing the point here. What exactly are you hoping to achieve here?

Do you agree?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No: &quot;a question that nearly anyone can answer with minimal thought&quot; sounds like 'not a real question', which are normally closed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, you're here to see what I don't: to interest new users more than existing users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both questions are accessible imo in that, surely, every cyclist is and/or knows commuters, and/or women (see also [Demographics of cycle commuters](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/3335/demographics-of-cycle-commuters) and [How to encourage people close to me to become cyclists?](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/4164/how-to-encourage-people-close-to-me-to-become-cyclists)). And they're novice-level questions, i.e. asked by a novice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They're genuine and pointed though, not trivial, specific, perhaps difficult (the second because it's commuting 10,000 km/year, the first because of wheel size and weight), edge cases: real questions with non-trivial answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Can you tell me anything substantive about bikes for commuting, or light ladies bikes? Or do you want to know what other people say about them? If not, then what you're asking for, what you mean by 'accessible', might be a kind of 'discussion' question which solicits &quot;What is your experience with...?&quot; and &quot;How do you feel about...?&quot; (which are also normally closed) ... or which could be more appropriate for the Chat (which, like the blog, is another facet of the platform) than for the Q+A main board.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Or maybe you have no questions about gear, and prefer questions about techniques; or about places.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the (existing) real questions are too difficult to be accessible, could you select several of them to promote (everyone can answer one of a selection of questions even if they can't answer all of them)? Could you promote different questions to different audiences?

(I've been on a few of them.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From the answer: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The issue is actually quite complex. Some &quot;wrong-way&quot; routes can be quite safe if well-designed, marked, and implemented. Much of the data and research in this area is in French because &quot;contresens pistes cyclable&quot; have been implemented in several French cities such as Paris, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, and Lyon, among others. In addition, a few other countries have implemented similar bike ways, such as Belgium, Switzerland, Japan, and the Netherlands. In general, these &quot;counter-direction&quot; bikeways are in dense urban areas with many narrow one-way streets and restricted speed limits (usually, 30 to 40 km/h, or around 20 to 25 mph). A 200 page report from the Institut Federatif de Recherche sur Les Economies et Les Societes Indutrielles (one of the French research institutes) of the experiences in 5 French cities can be found [here][1] (in French) and a short PowerPoint presentation by the lead author of that study can be found [here][2] (again, in French). No accidents were observed on contresens bikeways in the study area during the period from 2002-6. A two-page illustrated brochure advocating the expansion of contresens urban pistes can be found [here][3]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; On a personal note, I was surprised when a contresens piste cyclable was marked on my narow one-way street in Paris. I initially thought it to be suicidal but after riding on it for two blocks I understood why it could be safer: a study of **every** bicycle fatality in Paris in 2005 had shown that the single largest cause of death was being right-hooked at intersections, and the contresens bikeways completely eliminated this danger.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.fubicy.org/spip.php?article157&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.fubicy.org/avon/moret/Moret/Contresens%20VaV.ppt&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.droitauvelo.org/DOC/FICHES/fiche1.pdf" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Nothing too terrible, and it was relevant to the answer. If comment threads get too long, they're truncated automatically, hidden under a link that reads &quot;add/show [x] more comments]&quot;.

I wouldn't be surprised if a mod contacted these users over this, but whether they did or no is confidential information. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Heated comment threads on some sites are deleted, but Bicycles seems to trend towards just leaving the comments there unless they're *really* bad. If I see anything really bad, I'll leave a comment suggesting people cool down if I think they'll listen, or flag it for the mods, or both. But it can be tough to tell where the useful discussion ends and the flaming begins. When I was modding here, I'd delete very sparingly, and err on the side of not deleting stuff. I suspect that's still the case, so we're gonna see a little anger from time to time. I'm fine with that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unless I've been missing a *lot* around here, people here are pretty polite and well-spoken, for the most part. I think that slightly heated comment threads like this are outliers. A little discussion in the comments from time to time can highlight an interesting issue.

Adding parenthetical lbs, kg, mi, km, tempF, tempC, etc is a common edit on questions and answers, in order to increase the audience. Many things on our site deal with physical measurement units. Many people only understand one unit system or the other, or simply have a better feel for one or the other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I see a few problems with your plan of dropping that JS in place:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Surprise changes to the text could be confusing and end up with things like &quot;3 miles (4.82 km) (5 km (3.13 miles))&quot;. We want to be very careful with anything that effectively changes the markup (or any behavior) on our site to be different from other sites in the Stack Exchange network.&#xD;&#xA;2. Your script adds significant digits inappropriately. &quot;5 km&quot; should convert to &quot;3 miles&quot; or maybe &quot;3.1&quot; miles, never &quot;3.13&quot; or &quot;3.11&quot;. Adding more than 1 significant digit is just wrong, since it adds implied accuracy. Counting the significant digits of the input and using that many significant digits (or 1 more) on output would be a good start.&#xD;&#xA;3. Your conversions are wrong. I only checked one, but you have 0.626 as the km to miles conversion, and it should be 0.62137 or 0.621.&#xD;&#xA;4. Doing it automatically is always going to get it a bit wrong now and then. Some uses of inches and cm (such as heights) should be converted, even though (as you point out) some shouldn't. The difference is in context, not anything a computer will be able to automatically detect reliably. Anything that excludes certain simple units while automatically handling others will confuse people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ways I could see automatic conversion working well:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* A feature for assisting people in converting units, and make it available on all SE sites that routinely need such conversions. Perhaps a button that when you highlight text like &quot;5 inches&quot; changes it to &quot;5 inches (13 cm)&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;* An automatic system that subtly highlighted units with a known conversion and displayed the conversion on mouse hover.

I agree that it's good to encourage healthy discussion. However, I don't think that closing and downvoting are inherently unfriendly, and I think the community is accepting of almost any answerable question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the end, I think it's hard to talk about this in general, so it's better to raise specific cases where you disagree and when possible to try to edit/improve content. For example, I recently edited the question &#xD;&#xA;https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/10821/how-does-a-two-wheel-drive-bike-work&#xD;&#xA;because I thought it contained the kernel of a great question. I agree with the original closing, though, because it was vague and unanswerable. I think it's worthy of reopening now, but I don't think there was anything wrong with closing it. Looking at other questions that have been closed recently, I really can't argue with most of them. For example, https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/10870/link-to-a-photo-of-eddy-merckx-seen-from-below-the-bike&#xD;&#xA;is searching for a very specific photograph, which is an impossibly specific request.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I upvote far more often than I downvote, but I generally downvote any question that seems inherently unanswerable, chatty (&quot;What is your favorite...?&quot;), or requests recommendation of a specific model or brand of something (answers to such questions expire almost instantly). In general, I think that I and others on the site tend to be pretty accepting of questions that are more subjective than other Stack Exchange Sites. The only major area where I seem to disagree with others is that I think that medical and especially first aid questions should be considered on-topic. When people downvote answers, they may either think that the answer is wrong or that it's not really an answer or would be more appropriate as a comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do you have specific questions where you disagree with everyone else? If so, I recommend either adding a comment about how why you think it is a good question, or to add a specific meta question. I agree that it's nice to add a comment about why you're downvoting, but it's not strictly necessary. And it's just as helpful for someone who likes a post to add a comment about why they like it as for someone who dislikes it to add a comment about why they dislike."

I won't bother with making excuses, so here goes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would first contact the other moderator to find out their opinion on the matter and, conversely, express mine. Hopefully, that would clear up the issue and we could agree on whether to retract the original decision or leave it in place. If not, we would naturally bring in the other moderators and hopefully reach a consensus. Barring a consensus, my thought would be to leave the question open (regardless of whether I wanted it closed or open) so that the community could then vote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a) What is, in your opinion as a potential future moderator, the biggest problem that bicycles.SE currently faces? b) If you were to get elected, what actions would you take towards resolving these issues?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think our biggest problem right now is similar to what nhinkle said: too few members. However, I have a different take on that problem. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Right now, because of our relatively small numbers, we have a problem reaching a consensus on issues relevant to the future of the site, and even when we do reach a consensus, we have a problem enforcing it. For example, we've reached a consensus on what type of shopping questions we allow, but we regularly see shopping questions that don't fit our criteria sit open because we don't have enough people voting to close them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, I don't have the insider track that Nathan has, so I'm not sure if this is within the realm of power that a mod has, but I'd like to see either the vote thresholds lowered for smaller SE sites like ours, or the length of time that a vote remains active made longer. Lowering the threshold would be my preference between the two. I think three votes represents a consensus  for our community. And if that's too aggressive for a question or two once in a while, we can always vote to reopen. I've actually had to do that with a question I posted on AskUbuntu and it's a relatively painless process. (Incidentally, that question has been [super popular][1].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would first make the assumption that the user wasn't being intentionally argumentative/hostile/rude/whatever the problem is and that it was all unintentional. Under that assumption, I would contact the user and let them know that we had received a number of flags and illustrate that the perceived problems with his/her posts. I think that with most users, this would solve the problem. If it did not solve the problem, I would ask the other mods for their opinions on how to proceed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Delete spam. Delete lots and lots of spam. Seriously though...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of what they do, as I understand it, is getting rid of stuff that obviously doesn't fit the site, obviously off-topic questions, &quot;I'm having this problem too&quot; type answers that don't actually provide an answer, etc. They also handle the problems that users with less rep (less than 10k) bring to their attention, i.e., flags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beyond that, I really can't say it better than [A Theory of Moderation][2]: Moderators are human exception handlers.&quot; 99% of the time, the site chugs along under its own steam and the community takes care of problems. Every once in a while, something weird pops up that is so borderline that the community can't come to a consensus. This is when the moderators would have to step in (as a group, of course) and make a decision. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm fine with that. I make a conscious effort to be civil and polite in my writing style. I'm aware that my posts will be seen as more authoritative with the moderator diamond next to them, and I'm sure I've made mistakes in the past, but I also make a conscious effort to admit when I'm wrong (in life, as well as on this site), which I think would alleviate any of those errors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is probably not the right thing to say when I'm running for a moderator position, but I think I would actually be *less* effective as a mod than I would as a regular user with 10k+ rep. As I mentioned in my [nomination][3], I'm the most active reviewer on the site. I review with reckless abandon right now, comfortable in the knowledge that all of my decisions will be checked and double checked by other users and are ultimately just a drop in the bucket of community consensus. I will have to tone myself back some as a mod, leaving fringe cases open to the community. And as I mentioned above, this means that some edge cases that the community probably, but not obviously, wants closed could remain open. Soooo...yeah. Don't...vote...for...me? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But seriously, do. And then hit the review queue hard if you have the rep. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What's your take on [link-only answers](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/tags/link-only-answers/info) that get flagged for not being answers? Should they be removed when flagged, or are they worth keeping around if they answer the question? See also: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/28/avoiding-just-buy-a-new-one-or-heres-a-link-answers&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming that the link does, in fact, answer the question, I think they should be edited into a workable answer. Preferably, someone would comment and the person who posted it would do it. Barring that, I would hope that a community member would do it. I realize that's not necessarily realistic. I would still tend to think that as long as it offers something valuable, it should be left up. If the link dies, then it's time to take it down. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Do you think bicycles has too many unanswered questions? Why not? If so, what would you do about it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nope. As nhinkle mentioned, only 1.5% of our questions are &quot;unanswered.&quot; I put that in quotes, because only 1% are actually without answers, the other 0.5% have answers without votes. Compared to a lot of SE sites (including the big dogs like Stack Overflow) that have 15-30% unanswered questions, a 99% answer rate is pretty darn good. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://askubuntu.com/questions/194651/why-use-apt-get-upgrade-instead-of-apt-get-dist-upgrade&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/election/2#post-20533" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

If the question can be made more objective / less localized / more coherent / etc. (whatever would prevent it from being closed), without altering the question's meaning, then edit it. Stop.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Assuming the question can't be edited due to insufficient detail (which is the case for at least 90% of closed subjective questions) then it goes down one of the following two tracks:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. Leave a comment warning that the question as written is likely to be closed.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. Suggest how the author could improve the question.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. If the author fails to respond within a reasonable time (i.e. a few hours), actually vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The other strategy, which is the one [they] prefer, is:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. Immediately vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. Leave a comment explaining (politely!) why you voted to close.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. Suggest how the author could improve the question, or appeal the decision on meta.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. Return to the question several hours later, and if it has been closed and also edited (improved), then vote to reopen it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since Bicycles.SE is a low traffic site, I (andy256) tend to leave posts a few days after posting a message and before taking the next step.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also check their reputation.

If no one has posted a Welcome message I also go through the [First Post Review process](https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1028/8273). If they have a rep of 101 then they're probably from another site and should know how things work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Follow your own judgment on the close reason. On this site the reasons are not always exactly applicable, and it's common for a question to have multiple reasons for being closed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember, for spam, just flag it as spam. Don't edit, don't vote to close; those actions just give more visibility and muddy the water. When it's got 6 spam flags it will be automatically deleted." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Each existing answer seems like it could be an end-point for the &quot;Close as Duplicate&quot; option. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an example from the posted question, I would ask the following question and question body:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## How do I make sure a bike fits when purchasing in person? ##&#xD;&#xA;I'm look at buying a bicycle. It may be either new or used, but I will have a chance to test ride it in person before I purchase it. What do I need to know and check to make sure it fits?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this case, the answer would be most of the links that are included in the current answer [here](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/41044/213).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using the cannonical question format would also help with some of the canned comments that many mods and high-rep users fall back on when we see similar posts. On example I use all the time is when closing as a product rec I frequently add the comment:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Product recommendation questions are generally a poor fit for a Q&amp;A site since the answers quickly become out of date. There are a number of previous posts that will help you know what to look for when buying a new/first road bike [link1](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/7979/213), [link2](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/1121/213), commuter bike [link1](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/23282/213), [link2](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/15696/213) and mountain bike [link1](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/6238/213) [link2](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/5745/213).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These could then be either closed a duplicates, or still closed as product rec but linked in the comments to the relevant cannonical question."

On the main stack, or [English](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions), most questions get a (fairly definitive) answer within *minutes*, and are also quickly pushed of the front page.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I observe an approach of *well since nobody else has answered, I'll have a go*. Any answer, or a partial answer, being better than none. Often this has the effect of triggering other answers in response.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes a short answer that *could* have been a comment is all that is required; one or two of your own answers are in this category.

But because of the small user base, no answer has ever achieved [Great Answer](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/badges/40/great-answer) status. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The voting patterns are interesting (to me, at least). Question pages with 50 or so views commonly get 4 or so votes, spread between the question and the answers. But pages with thousands of views tend to get far lower voting rates per view.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, on the one hand, the early voting tends to be quite generous, encouraging people who answer. But the later voting suggests something like *meh, (s)he's got enough votes*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the view of generous voting is also supported by the culture that we have very few downvotes, preferring to upvote other answers or leaving a comment. Looking at the voting figures for the top 50 users shows a downvote rate of about 1% or 2% of the upvotes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The mouse-over for the vote buttons says&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* This answer is useful&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* This answer is not useful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They don't say *correct* and *incorrect*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I think we tend to upvote answers that are *useful*, and downvote answers that are seen as wrong, rude/abusive or even dangerous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To answer the question - I think it's due to the small size of the user base.

There's not much difference, except late answers are always ... answers, and there seems to be a higher chance of spam.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a wiki post, consider it as a draft and feel free edit at will. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The options you have are&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Upvote and approve**  &#xD;&#xA;I've been doing this more often, lately. It's a way of showing the user they're on the right track.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Downvote and approve**  &#xD;&#xA;I don't do this ever. Would others like to comment?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Skip the post**  &#xD;&#xA;Do this if you're not sure what to do with it. If you want to see what others do, you can open the post (the question title links to the question) and star it (make it a favorite). Come back to it in a day or so to see that happened. You can also click the &quot;history&quot; link to see *all* the reviews.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another reason to skip it is if you think you're not being impartial. This happens to me (andy256) sometimes when I've already answered a question and then find it on the review queue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Approve without comment**  &#xD;&#xA;Often other users have already posted comments or answers by the time you see the post on the queue. If any concerns have already been addressed then it makes sense to just approve it.  &#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, some new users just seem to get it. So much so that a nice encouraging welcome message seems out of place. If you're not leaving a nice message, consider an up vote. I (andy256) have done this more often, lately.  &#xD;&#xA;New users with 101 rep have come from another site, so they often don't need guidance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Flag the post**  &#xD;&#xA;After clicking *Flag* you get several options. In my understanding, most of them lead to the post getting onto other review queues, or to a queue for moderator attention. Flag the post when you think there's something wrong with it. Sometimes it seems worthwhile to leave a comment explaining that you're flagging the post and what the user could do about it, but only do this if the post seems salvageable. If not then don't try to discuss it with the poster, just flag it and let others deal with it. Some flag actions seem to automatically create a downvote (spam questions, for example - keep flagging them, after 6 flags they get deleted).  &#xD;&#xA;When a post should have been a comment (the newbie doesn't have enough rep to post comments) you can flag for moderator attention, and politely ask them to convert it to a comment. Leave a comment for the user to explain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Approve with a comment**  &#xD;&#xA;If you include [Bicycles.SE] in your comment it gets converted to link to the site. I like to add @username (I learned it on [English.se]) because it gives an example of how to address a user in comments (it has no effect in this case, but it is an example).

We recommend that new users take the \[tour\] so that you can make best use of the site.  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  If it's a question I add at the end of that sentence&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; and since you're asking, see \[ask\].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The \[ask\] part gets converted to a link to [Help Center &gt; Asking](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask).  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  If it's an answer I add at the end of that sentence&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; and since you're answering, see \[answer\].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The \[answer\] part gets converted to a link to [Help Center &gt; Answering](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer).  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;Here are some examples of comments on first posts, and a few snippets&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Example](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/32229/8273) from dlu. This is a nice example showing positive language and a response (seemingly) written specifically for the post.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Welcome to Bicycles! You may want to spend some time on the tour to get an idea of how Stack Exchange works – we encourage answers to questions supported by evidence. The idea is that we can learn from each other's experience and knowledge. It also helps to take care with formatting and grammar in your answers. Readability counts.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* When a post is a discussion instead of a question or answer (lately I've included the \[tour\] comment mentioned above)  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Welcome to [Bicycles.SE] @username. This site is different - it's not a discussion (although you can use \[chat\]\(http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/214/the-velodrome\) for that).  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;* When an answer should be a question  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To ask your own question, start at the \[Ask Question\]\(https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/ask\) link at the top right of the Questions page, and fire away. Also check out [ask], and do a search to see if your question has already been asked and answered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* When a post is the basis for an answer, but too short (from jimirings). The post was an answer to https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/692/what-to-use-to-clean-your-chain-and-cogs&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Welcome to Bicycles SE. We're looking for answers with \[more detail\]\(https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer\). Please consider expanding your answer to explain why auto body degreaser and simple green are good solutions for the OP's problem. You might also explain why the OP wouldn't want to use auto degreaser all the time. A short, one-line answer like this is likely to get downvoted, flagged for moderator intervention, and possibly deleted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* When a post should have been a comment  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; When you have enough \[rep\]\(https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/privileges\) such a post could be made as a comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; It is a site where good answers should become definitive references. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; We're looking for answers with \[more detail\]\(https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer\).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; As this answer stands, it is likely to be downvoted and possibly deleted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; Also note that we ask that you \[be nice\]\(https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice\) on this site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is an example of a poor review: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/32362/8273. I (andy256) saw that it had parenting content, and mildly suggested that [parenting.se] would be more appropriate. Then I couldn't help myself and added an unhelpful comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A better approach might have been to edit the question, removing all parenting references, and leaving a question that just compared DH skiing and biking. The whole interaction would have been different after that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And finally, a very nice [review](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/44346/how-to-bend-handlebar-to-customize-it/44389#comment93595_44389) from rclocher3:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hi Alan, and welcome to the site! We recommend all new users take [the tour](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/tour) to get the most from the site, and since you volunteered an answer, it couldn't hurt to also read [how to answer](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer). Regarding your answer, electrical conduit is meant to be bent when installed, but I'm skeptical about bending handlebars the same way; handlebars have different metallurgy, because they're meant to be light, stiff, and strong. Of course someone might try using handlebars made from conduit ;) Again, welcome." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The consensus there is that what is really needed is a canonical answer. Webmasters SE provides a couple of [good examples][2] of how to implement this. I think the best way for us to do this would be a single question that covers an overview on choosing a bike (e.g., fit, benefits of old vs. new, etc.), how to choose between different styles of bikes (e.g., CX, XC, road), and then how to choose within each classification. It would be a monstrous answer for sure, but I think it would be a better catch-all than individual questions since newbies are often asking all of those questions bundled together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The drivetrain compatibility question is significantly thornier. I like the idea overall since it would be nice not to have a thousand different compatibility questions, but I think it would be too unwieldy to be realistically attainable. Even if we confined it to the more common brands (Shimano, Sram, Campy, Suntour, etc.) you practically need a flowchart to keep it all straight between companies, number of gears, road vs. mountain, etc. Throw in the odd balls (Rohloff, Sturmey-Archer, NuVinci) and it gets really hairy. And what happens when technology progresses? Electronic shifting and belt drives are sure to offer potential new realms of compatibility issues. There are rumors floating around that 12 speed drive trains in the works. And then there's the question of what to do about combos that work, but sub-optimally? It really gets dizzying and I just don't see how it can all be contained in a single question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/823/what-type-of-bike-should-i-buy/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

So while off-road is clearly on-topic here on Bicycles, perhaps a dedicated off-roading proposal can encourage more questions about these topics. A little overlap isn't a problem, as long as people are clear on where to ask a question. You'll need to figure out how to present this in your FAQ, as will we, if and when your proposal becomes a site. Something like &quot;Off-road, focusing on the issues faced off-road vehicles. While we cover off-road bicycles, questions about mechanical issues or general bicycle riding might get more answers at Bicycles.&quot; But who knows?

OTOH, questions with a single upvote and a few answers with maybe 1 upvote hasn't really been &quot;rated&quot; by the Stackexchange system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So a single downvote (or upvote) shouldn't be treated as a big deal, it usually means the question simply struck someone as not being very good.

If you've been on any of the `.moderated` newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. *Anyone* can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question *back into review/improve mode*. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... *happen*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Why do we close a question?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on *problems you face* or things you are trying to understand. The [don't ask](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask) section of the FAQ gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions belong elsewhere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, *broadly speaking* true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Is closing like deletion?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put &quot;into improve mode&quot; if you like, and are still visible for *anyone* to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different - they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What are the requirements for closing a question?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have 3000 reputation, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option &quot;this question does not belong here&quot;. That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Why can anyone vote to close/reopen**?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Firstly, anyone can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such) because it is *your site*. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How are moderators different?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Initially, as the reputation requirement rules out many users, you will see moderators doing most of the closing to guide the site and look after the content. As you gain in reputation, you get to join in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Ok, so how does it work?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Example close button][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Close vote reasons dialog][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Other votes][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.&#xD;&#xA; * The &quot;off topic&quot; page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. On SE betas, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind.&#xD;&#xA; * The other options are straight out closes.&#xD;&#xA; * Once you pick your option and click &quot;close&quot;, your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.&#xD;&#xA; * If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.&#xD;&#xA; * Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Close banner][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How does vote to re-open work?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A closed question has a &quot;reopen&quot; link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Re-open link][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What happens if I make a mistake?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't worry! Unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**My name appears on the bottom - isn't this going to cause problems with other users?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually there are two tools for this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * [Review][6]. Here, there are a number of options for seeing things that might need say editing. One of these is a tab for all questions with close votes. You are then free to look at the question and decide if you agree.&#xD;&#xA; * [Tools][7]. Commonly referred to as the &quot;10k tools&quot;, this page let's you see even more information - certain anonymous flags, re-open votes, delete votes etc. The important one for this is the re-open page. Here, you can see questions that might have been closed incorrectly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Entire post blatantly stolen from [this meta.crypto.se answer](https://crypto.meta.stackexchange.com/a/130/1677) by [Ninefingers](https://crypto.meta.stackexchange.com/users/46/ninefingers) and barely modified at all)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3F4V.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/review&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/tools" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

How is it&#xD;&#xA;&gt; made? Where does it grow?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IMO the main thing wrong with that is not that it's too 'basic' or too 'broad', but that *it doesn't identify a problem*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another example was from StackOverflow:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How do I move the turtle in LOGO?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IMO the main thing wrong with that is that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Programmers are supposed to know the first thing about what they're doing.&#xD;&#xA;2. There's a huge (and unwelcome) gap between that question and the experts reading it&#xD;&#xA;3. The question reveals a questioner who's so clueless that the task of adequately informing them is daunting (read about how to spot a &quot;[help vampire][3]&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An equivalent question on this site would be, &quot;How do you learn to ride a bike?&quot; ([however even that question isn't too basic for this site][4]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps vocabulary questions are too simple (&quot;What is *a derailleur*?&quot;); but, that's adequately/easily answered by a single 'Terminology' Q+As.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest that the existing FAQ is adequate: that a question is OK as long as ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* It's phrased as a question&#xD;&#xA;* It's about bicycles&#xD;&#xA;* It's practical; it's answerable; and it's based on an actual problem that you face&#xD;&#xA;* It's not subjective; not a disguised rant; not merely hypothetical; and not just idle curiosity&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps mods and high-rep users should readily use &quot;vote to close&quot; on questions which don't meet any/all of these criteria defined in the FAQ (on a higher-traffic sites like StackOverflow, it's easy/easier to find 5 users who are willing to close off-topic/inappropriate non-questions; there can be be 5 votes-to-close within the first minute).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally I don't think that &quot;too basic&quot; need be a criterion, because I'm guessing that, unlike with programming, and I might be wrong, a question that's a real problem but 'too basic' might have a correspondingly brief answer. Or maybe not: maybe there are some questions like, &quot;How do I build a wheel?&quot;, that would take too much explanation to answer properly?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What would you suggest as examples of answers which meet the FAQ criteria but are 'too basic'?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also suggest that for as long as Bicycles is relatively low-traffic and wants to welcome new users, you can afford to allow even basic questions, as long as the questions are 'high quality' in other ways.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not one of your expert users though, so beware; a different point of view is that [you mustn't drown out what expert-to-expert conversation there is][5] (however you interpret/perceive 'drown out').&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the subject of 'community' and 'experts': when I said above that &quot;programmers are supposed to know the first thing about what they're doing&quot; I meant that, IMO, 'professional and enthusiast programmers' ought to know about using e.g. Google to find a tutorial and/or reference to introduce the elementary use of any given programming language. If someone doesn't do that, then they are [arguably not &quot;a programmer&quot; at all as described in the first sentence of the StackOverflow FAQ][1]. In contrast, the audience for Bicycles is defined as &quot;[people who build and repair bicycles, people who train cycling, or commute on bicycles][2]&quot;: I'm not aware of questions about bicycles that could be so &quot;basic&quot; as to prove that the questioner isn't a member of *that* group. Here the FAQ allows commuters (bicycle users), as well as builders. The corresponding programming forums are split into several distinct forums (one forum for narrow coding questions, another for more subjective how-to-be-a-programmer questions, another for server administrators, another for UI designers, another for computer end-users, etc.). This forum, with a wider audience, a broader range of experience, might therefore invite a wider range of questions (including some more 'basic' questions).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/faq&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/faq&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/452&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/258/what-does-self-support-mean-during-touring/262#262" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Downvote&#xD;&#xA;2. Leave a detailed comment as to why I downvoted. I usually explicitly state _-1_ in the comment so that the answerer knows:&#xD;&#xA;   - It was me that downvoted (as opposed to the rogue downvoter who can't be bothered to leave feedback ;] )&#xD;&#xA;   - There is a specific reason why&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Star the question. I like to keep tabs on the activity of the question so that I do not erroneously leave a downvote on an answer that might change. I think this is important and a lot of people choose to downvote and leave which can push people away especially when voters fail to leave a reason or upvote a comment that covers why they downvoted.&#xD;&#xA;4. If the answerer improves their post or if enough time has passed, I remove it from my favorites. This time varies from post to post depending on the activity on the question but usually I will leave it starred for 2 or 3 weeks to give the answerer time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind that this is the exact reason to downvote. It shouldn't be taken offensively, [StackExchange was built this way on purpose](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/vote-down). It should be motivation to leave good, thorough answers that can be proven _and_ improve answers that can be ameliorated. If you feel that you cannot provide this in an answer then you probably should leave it as a comment. If it is due to the way a question is asked, consider editing the question or notifying OP that the answers to their question are likely to be subjective.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the option of leaving a conflicting answer is at times a good solution but, you should only leave an answer when you're able to leave concrete facts or examples. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;One minor thing to add; many users don't visit a post again after downvoting so keep this in mind when providing an answer that's lacking proof/evidence that you might plan to provide later. &lt;/sub&gt;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The community team (over all of stack exchange) reaches out to the moderators about once a year just to see how everyone is doing and if we think there needs to be a change or addition to the site moderation team.&#xD;&#xA; 2. The community team may notice at any time that the volume of posts or flags may have increased beyond the ability of the current moderation team to handle, and will suggest adding members. &#xD;&#xA; 3. The moderation team for this site can decide we want additional help and ask for an election.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Any individual member of the moderation team may decide that they no longer have the time or interest to be a moderator and ask to be replaced.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What about the activity level of the current moderators? ##&#xD;&#xA;Criggie in his comment on the original post is correct that the &quot;Last Post&quot; time does not in any way reflect the last time any of us were active as moderators. In general I think all 4 of us log in at least multiple times a week, if not multiple times a day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can't speak for the other mods, but when I log in most days I am no longer worried at all about posting answers, and I rarely have a question that I think is unique or universal enough that I feel like asking it. I usually get in, check my normal inbox like everyone sees, check the moderation inbox for flags or messages, maybe check the most recent posts for any obvious issues and get out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When it comes to the chat, I usually don't have the ability during my working day to keep the Velodrome open. So if there are problems there I personally won't see them unless they are flagged or I am summoned with an @ message.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Is the current moderator activity level a problem? ##&#xD;&#xA;Well, I'm likely biased, but when I say &quot;No, it's not a problem.&quot; these are my reasons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **We now have a core group of very active and helpful very high-reputation users.** Three of those users are now above the highest reputation threshold (25k) and can do all actions except those very few that require specific rights as a moderator. Those are primarily restricted because they grant access to contact and suspend specific users, or involve communicating directly with mods of other SE sites and the community team for help with issues.&#xD;&#xA; 2. **Review queue handling has been reasonably quick and thorough for some time.** In the early days of the site the moderators had to be heavily involved in reviewing all questions and answers. We seem to have arrived at a fairly well established set of &quot;norms&quot;, and like in point 1, we have a solid group of users who are actively clearing the review queue.&#xD;&#xA; 3. **Flag handling times have been fairly consistent.** Since the graduation of the site from Area 51, the moderator flag handling time has hovered pretty consistently around the same lag time. I'm not going to reveal what that time is, and it's likely not nearly as fast as some of the higher traffic sites. But for the amount of traffic we get, I think it's appropriate. There may be a few instances where, because all of the mods are in the western hemisphere, a flag comes in at the end of our day and none of us look at it until the next day. If users are unhappy with that lag, please reach out to us in chat and we will happily discuss it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Is the site running smoothly? ##&#xD;&#xA;I think so. There are occasional issues like a grouchy user here or there, or a spam account pops up. Those seem IMHO to be handled fairly quickly. As mods, I think we rarely take the most serious actions like warning or suspending a user without contacting each other and coming to a consensus. We may have slight differences (like I think I and one other mod may be quicker on the trigger than the other two when it comes to deleting long and chatty comment threads...)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What about complex actions like tag edits that only moderators can do? ##&#xD;&#xA;If you come across a serious issue that you don't know how to handle the best thing is to find a relevant question, answer, or comment and flag it for moderator attention. Use &quot;Other&quot; and explain what is going on. A slightly less reliable alternative for something that is really not tied to a specific post would be to @ one of us in the Velodrome. We'll get notified in our inbox and be around eventually. If it's a critical problem and one of the mods is slow getting back to you, the problem can be escalated to the community team using the contact link in the site footer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Finally - Thanks to the community! ##&#xD;&#xA;I will speak on behalf of all the mods in this case. Thank you to all of you wonderful members who &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - spend your time in the review queue, &#xD;&#xA; - watch and flag posts and comments, &#xD;&#xA; - edit posts and approve edits,&#xD;&#xA; - keep the conversation going in the Velodrome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have a fantastic community, and in my contact with mods from other sites I find it gratifying how smoothly things normally work here.

So, here are some generalizations:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The number of questions and answers that have been posted over the last four months has been relatively static. There's actually been a slight drop since the New Year, but nothing that I would call statistically significant. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our total page views are a different story. There was a slow steady decline in page views through all of Q4 2017. And, you guessed it, a spike at the beginning of January that has been more or less holding steady since then (as of Jan 18). If we go back further, we see the same thing happened at the beginning of 2017. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One interesting thing that I noted when looking further back in the past is that, as you might expect, our traffic follows a pretty predictable pattern throughout the year. There's small jump in traffic every January. Unlike the New Year's gym participation, that level of traffic holds and even begins to climb until it peaks about mid-summer, at which time it slowly declines to a low at the end of December. That pattern can be seen all the way back to the launch of our public beta in 2010 (2011 really, since we launched near the end of summer in 2010). &#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&#xD;&#xA; - If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1267" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

For example, [Oxford Dictionaries'](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/accident) primary definition of &quot;accident&quot; is &quot;An unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly and unintentionally, typically resulting in damage or injury&quot; and they give &quot;A crash involving road or other vehicles&quot; as a specific defining example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Other people think that &quot;accident&quot; is inappropriate because it suggests that nobody was to blame and nothing could have been done to avoid it. For example, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#Terminology) says, in an article that's mostly about motor vehicle collisions, &quot;This is because the term 'accident' implies that there is no-one to blame, whereas most traffic collisions are the result of driving under the influence, excessive speed, distractions such as mobile phones or other risky behavior.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* On the gripping hand, [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/accident)'s definition of &quot;accident&quot; includes &quot;an unfortunate event resulting especially from carelessness or ignorance&quot; with &quot;was involved in a traffic accident&quot; as a specific example of this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I tend slightly towards the &quot;accident suggests blamelessness&quot; camp, though I guess my cut-off is that if the parties were merely negligent rather than reckless, then I don't have any real objection to &quot;accident&quot;. On the other hand, it's hard to object to &quot;crash&quot; or &quot;collision&quot;, except on grounds that they're not the words the OP chose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since I feel that both camps have a decent argument, my recommendation would be that **we should probably stick with the OP's phrasing**."

It suggests in normal usage that there was no-one who did anything wrong, it just happened. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Words like crash, or collision, describe an event which happened, but do not attribute blame (or lack thereof) themselves. They are neutral.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order to promote safety for all road (or off-road) users, it's important to recognise that crashes have at least one root cause, even if it was non-deliberate. That way we can learn from the event and attempt to improve in future. Using the word 'accident' discourages reflection and improvement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In our example, OP using the word accident absolves both parties of blame. Even with a neutral standpoint, there must be some root cause(s) of the collision, which can be learnt from. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't see sufficient foreseeable cases to justify keeping the accident tag, whilst also pursuing safer roads for all road users.

To build a community of like-minded cyclists of all types.  Someone who contributes to the end goal of improving the overall quality and depth of the results should be valued and encouraged.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An argument that is on topic is still helping the answer to evolve and improve and should be shaped toward that goal.  An argument that becomes personal or detracts should be redirected if possible, or stopped completely.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is no private chat/message in SE, so anything communicated has to be done so in the open.  Must be mindful of how an interaction could be interpreted, especially if the parties are of different cultures/backgrounds or even English skills.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, I'd sleep on it.  Sometimes speedy action can result in the wrong course of action being followed.   Then I'd think it over with specific focus on &quot;is this enlarging the bicycles.SE resource or not?&quot;  If no clear answer is forthcoming I'd attempt to discuss with the other mod/s in the secret moderator retreat and come to some result.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anything more concrete would depend a lot on the question that was closed, by who and who asked it, what dupes there are, whether its a &quot;long-term&quot; question etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators moderate.  They help keep the site on-topic and on-course by limiting the most extreme swings.   Ideally the hand of direction is very lightweight, through to non-existent.  So moderators do as little as required to keep things heading in the right direction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you deal with a moderation issue on a question where you have given an answer, or on a question that you have asked?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd initially stand back and see how things develop.  We're all adults here and adults shouldn't need to be parented.  If my answer or question is off topic enough that it needed moderator input, I'd let the matter be handled by another mod and would simply be just a user.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note, I asked this question originally.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Do you ride, and why? If no, why not?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do ride - Mostly road commuting these days with a daily round trip of ~55 km 5 days a week.   I have successfully completed some organised road racing and MTB racing events, and have worked to foster more cycling in my workplaces.  I've also done some all-day endurance rides, and attempted to travel down every road in my city (still a work in progress.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As yet I have to try bikepacking/camping and anything to do with carbon bikes or disk brakes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have been an active member of ICEcycles (a community fixup cooperative) and when that got political I moved to CBC (which stands for something but we can't yet agree on.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why?  I ride for health and fitness, financial reasons (ie its cheaper than driving)  and I enjoy it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm indifferent.  The answers and questions should stand under their own merits, and who contributed them is immaterial in the long run.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Dunno.  I've already hit those rep levels, and have volunteered as moderator to help keep the election process moving forward.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions? Please ask in the comments."

This needs to be done within the [limits of the new unified theme](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/307862/ch-ch-ch-changes-left-nav-responsive-design-themes).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This could include colors of sections of the design or text, problems with JavaScript add-ons (if applicable), the logo or top banner appearance or other artwork.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also feel free to ask questions about the new layout if you're unsure how to navigate it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### On Meta Stack Exchange: General concerns about left nav or theming&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are some things that are definitely changing everywhere and can't really be adjusted on a per-site basis. A few of them include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Top banner is shorter in height, so some artwork has to be adjusted along with some logos.&#xD;&#xA;- Left Navigation is active everywhere (but can be collapsed into a menu by visiting your site preferences - [instructions here][1]).&#xD;&#xA;- Responsive layout is active, which lets the site adjust as browser widths change - no side scrolling (some pages haven't been updated, yet, though). For now, if you prefer the scrolling, you can disable this by clicking the &quot;disable responsiveness&quot; link in the footer.&#xD;&#xA;- Many site elements including tags and voting arrows are standardized across the network.&#xD;&#xA;- Link underlining is active. In an effort to make links more visible, they are now being underlined.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have concerns or issues regarding the left nav or the overall approach we are taking to theming, then [this Meta Stack Exchange post](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/310908/live-left-nav-new-theming-and-responsiveness) is the right place for feedback. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I mentioned earlier, there are some unique design elements like voting arrows and tags that are being standardized in this process. Keeping these custom elements makes our ability to maintain the sites too complex and, while we're very sad to see them go, we're in a difficult position of needing to make the site designs work together so that we can continue to address feature requests and bugs that will make your Q&amp;A experience better. This is addressed in a [Meta Stack Exchange post](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314799/why-we-initiated-the-latest-round-of-design-changes-and-the-role-of-meta) if you want more detail.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What new themes?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're like, &quot;What the heck are you talking about?&quot;, then you should read the Meta Stack Exchange post entitled [Rollout of new network site themes](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312365/rollout-of-new-network-site-themes) (and maybe the posts it links to for the full background).

Questions collected [from an earlier thread](https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1290/2018-moderator-election-qa-question-collection) have been compiled into this one, which shall now serve as the space for the candidates to provide their answers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Due to the submission count, we have selected all provided questions as well as our back up questions for a total of 7 questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a candidate, your job is simple - post an answer to this question, citing each of the questions and then post your answer to each question given in that same answer. For your convenience, I will include all of the questions in quote format with a break in between each, suitable for you to insert your answers. Just [copy the whole thing after the first set of three dashes](https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/72ba6d67-790b-4755-9e28-5e665b6195a9/view-source).Please consider putting your name at the top of your post so that readers will know who you are before they finish reading everything you have written, and also including a link to your answer on your nomination post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once all the answers have been compiled, this will serve as a transcript for voters to view the thoughts of their candidates, and will be appropriately linked in the Election page.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good luck to all of the candidates!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Oh, and when you've completed your answer, please provide a link to it after this blurb here, before that set of three dashes. Please leave the list of links in the order of submission.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To save scrolling here are links to the submissions from each candidate (in order of submission):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. [Rory Alsop's answers][1] &#xD;&#xA;2. [Criggie's answers][2]&#xD;&#xA;3. [Rider X's answers][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;1. How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;2. How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;3. In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;4. How would you deal with a moderation issue on a question where you have given an answer, or on a question that you have asked?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;5. Do you ride, and why? If no, why not?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;6. A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;7.

Perhaps they ride it, or might be for someone else to ride.  Key fact here is it is or will be ridden.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Those who own a bike/frame and want to identify it for resale - may ask about valuations as well.   Not interested in riding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Those who are doing some due diligence before buying a bike - tend to have a photo off craiglist or similar, and no actual access to the bike.  Possible they're looking for a valuable &quot;barn find&quot; for cheap, or on the hunt for a bargain.  They're trying to confirm the facts presented by the seller.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Last, those who have *already* bought a frame that was stated as &quot;being Tony Hawker's own G&amp;T Rampage from 1967&quot; and are trying to confirm that they've got something valuable.   Justify their purchase, as it were.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What other motivations are there for asking this question?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Knowing or identifying the underlying motivation should help us choose whether it is worth helping them or not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Separately - closing a question about a bog-standard BMX frame that will likely never be identified seems wise.  The longer its open, the more opportunity for someone new to post some unconfirmed statement like &quot;Its a GT Rambo!&quot;  with no supporting info.

And with the new year, as usual, comes a new iteration of **Community Promotion Ads**! Let’s refresh these for the coming year :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### What are Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&#xD;&#xA; - If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1317" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

" Text="I got [this question][1] closed and I'm really just looking for instructions on how to construct a bike light that has specific requirements and that is not available on the market.  This is, as far as I can tell, no different from asking how to improvise a chain for a fixed gear bicycle, or how to change a flat tire.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words I am looking for empirical examples of how the problem has  been solved. These examples could include links to projects, step by step instructions, or simply statements like &quot;Search for this category of product on this or these sites, you will find many solutions.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I note that the question brought in comments that got into product recommendations, but that was not my intent, and anyway, those are comments.

The question is to solve a problem of needing a low cost headlamp to scare away wildlife (coyotes) who have been bothering the rider and his dog. It is certainly of value to the original poster and of general value to those who ride at night in wild areas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am going to the time to dissect this because, as a member of the StackExchange community and new member of this site, I believe that this question is being unfairly excluded, at least according to the written guidelines provided with the site.  The question has had some good, valuable ideas and answers, community members had contributed quite a bit, and I hated the idea of the whole thing being closed off to additional input.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's why I raised this question in meta and that's why I am providing the following answer, for discussion, by the community.  I agree that the site should not be a dumping ground for spam, low quality questions/answers, or product recs.  However, when I think that this kind of question has a lot of community value, maybe not to pro bicyclists or bike shops, but definitely to ordinary folks who are using bicycles in their community. So the fact that the question was rapidly closed without a clear reason why **based on a relevant citation of the site guidelines**, gave me cause to invest a lot of time in this discussion. I want to help the community of maybe not all bicyclists, but maybe of some ordinary bicyclists, people like me who can't spend a lot of money on gear -- to get their questions answered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An example of an appropriate question/answer for this site, to help people in the community of bicycles would be as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Q: How do I fix a flat tire?  My ride is bumpy and my I can see the wheel is getting damage.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A1: Remove the innnertube.  Abrade the puncture and apply a rubber&#xD;&#xA;&gt; glue. Allow to cure and replace the tire.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A2: A1 is good but doesn't address blow outs.  Buy a new innertube. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; You can find them at a bike store, on Amazon or google them.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A3: A1 and A2 are correct but before you do A1 you should also check&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the tire for thorns.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A4: Go to a bicycle store and buy a new wheel, with tire and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; innertube. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason the question follows  this pattern is as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. It presents a clearly defined problem that might have one or more solutions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Answerers are free to provide a variety of responses, good and bad, that can be up/downvoted by the community.  Even though some answers might be downvoted _they still might be useful for some users._  Answers that are off topic can be voted off by users -- no moderator intervention required.  Answers that are partial can be combined with other answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. When it comes to problem solving, if the requirements are clear, anything that meets the requirements can be a valid solution, provided it has been proven in practice.  That's what separates opinion from fact.  Opinions are about 'the best way' to do something. Facts are 'this is a valid way to do something.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. It is not too broad (question can be answered effectively with the top voted response likely to meet most user's requirements.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. A2 and A3 could be posted as a comments, inviting A1 or A2 to be amended making it an even better answer.  This could be handled by down voting A2/A3 and in comments, asking answerer to submit answer as a comment to A1, with the author of A1 amending the answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. A4 might make sense to someone in a hurry, so though it's weird, it's a valid solution, e.g., it meets the requirements of the problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although the question linked by the original poster involves issues of cost, light output specifications, and detachability, these are making the problem _more specific_ not less.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does it meet the community guidelines?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Specific issues with bicycles.** Yes. A headlamp is part of a bicycle and is on the list of approved tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Specific issues with bicycling.**  Yes. The OP needed a light to deal with Coyotes chasing the bike.  Coyotes are definitely an issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Real problems or questions that you’ve encountered.**  Yes it's a real problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does it violate community guidelines?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Anything not directly related to bicycles or bicycling** No. As stated above, headlamps are in scope.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Questions that are primarily opinion-based** No, note above the definition of what is &quot;opinion&quot; -- a question like &quot;what's the best headlamp for this situation.&quot;  This question merely asks, &quot;how do I get or build a headlamp with these requirements.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Questions with too many possible answers or that would require an extremely long answer** No. This is pretty subjective and might be an area of contention. However, answers can typically be combined through the commenting process. Also, there are unlikely to be too many ways to solve this particular problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In regards to the previous entry in this discussion, a few points:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Existing Problems With The Question&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; In both the original and the edit you say that you have not found a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 300+ lumen light. There are a large number of existing bike lights&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that are 300+ lumens, though I suspect there may be none that run on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; consumer replaceable AA or AAA batteries. Five experienced members of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the community voted to close the question as &quot;Off Topic&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Per site guidelines, I edited the question to bring it on-topic. That's what the site told me to do after it was marked off-topic.  Was the problem here, that I put off the experienced members after I edited it?  Should I have deleted/reposted the question?  No. I've tried that before -- and was wrong.  People have submitted valid information and answers already. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Both those&#xD;&#xA;&gt; votes, and the close note appended to the question provide feedback.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I did not see any feedback that explained 1) why the question was too broad 2) how the question did not apply to bicycles -- headlamps is a valid tag -- or 3) why the question would require an answer of excessive length -- the stated &quot;topic requirements: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There were multiple comments on the original question, and there have&#xD;&#xA;&gt; been multiple comments on the edited question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many of the comments were to present a perspective on community guidelines -- when I saw this I created a post in meta, which is shown as the place to discuss these things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The question didn't&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;keep getting closed&quot; - it accumulated enough votes and was closed&#xD;&#xA;&gt; once.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I originally posted this question using different wording, closed and deleted it (my bad) so that's why I said &quot;keeps getting closed.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Finally - the primary point of the question seems to be &quot;How can&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I build a 300+ lumen light that runs of rechargable NiMH AA or AAA&#xD;&#xA;&gt; batteries.&quot; The fact that you want this to be detachable for a bicycle&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is ancillary to the main question. That question is not a good fit for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; this site, and would be better suited for the Electrical Engineering&#xD;&#xA;&gt; site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main problems -- what components, affixing to the bike, water, detachability, are outside of the realm of electrical engineering site:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a specific electronics design problem &#xD;&#xA;&gt; the theory and simulation of electromagnetic forces &#xD;&#xA;&gt; a communication scheme &#xD;&#xA;&gt; the writing of firmware for bare-metal or RTOS applications&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The way I get it, the EE site is about schematics and such, not about cases or mechanical issues.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I see a summary of points that have been addressed in my comments.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Issues With The Meta Post**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; With all due respect, your tone (hard to gauge in written&#xD;&#xA;&gt; communication, I know. Forgive me if I have misread it...) seems to be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; one of impatience out of whack with a site completely created and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; edited by volunteers:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's fair enough. Always GREAT to get feedback on tone. However, if that's actually a factor in closing the question (and you mentioning it here is why I'm bringing it up) isn't that a little unscientific?  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; It appears that you edited the question, and when it wasn't&#xD;&#xA;&gt; immediately reopened, came here to expreses dissatisfaction and try and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; get a moderator to intervene.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I came here to ask why the question was closed, because, as shown above, the commenters did not clearly show (to me) how the site guidelines were being applied to make the case. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Again, this post makes it seem like you&#xD;&#xA;&gt; have ignored the feedback given on the original question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Every comment criticizing the post was answered before I created the meta post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;This kind of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; conversation about how to modify a particular question that is getting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; downvotes or has been closed, is best suited for chat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Disagree. Meta is described as follows, in it's guidelines:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Meta Bicycles Stack Exchange is the part of the site where users&#xD;&#xA;&gt; discuss the workings and policies of Bicycles Stack Exchange rather&#xD;&#xA;&gt; than discussing bicycles itself. It is separated from the main Q&amp;A to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reduce noise there while providing a legitimate space for people to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ask how and why this site works the way it does. Meta is for...&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...Bicycles Stack Exchange users to communicate with each other about&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Bicycles Stack Exchange (asking questions about how the websites work,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or about policies and community decisions) ...Bicycles Stack Exchange&#xD;&#xA;&gt; users to communicate with Stack Overflow the company (posting bugs,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; suggesting improvements, or proposing new features), and ...Stack&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Overflow the company to communicate with the community (soliciting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; feedback on new ideas or features, or discussing policies that affect&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the whole network)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Okay, I am so exhausted here.  But I really am hoping we can open up this site to questions that would be relevant to my situation, the pauper vs. the coyotes.

Text="The question is appropriate and can be reopened.  The question is to solve a problem of needing a low cost headlamp to scare away wildlife (coyotes) who have been bothering the rider and his dog. It is certainly of value to the original poster and of general value to those who ride at night in wild areas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am going to the time to dissect this because, as a member of the StackExchange community and new member of this site, I believe that this question is being unfairly excluded, at least according to the written guidelines provided with the site.  The question has had some good, valuable ideas and answers, community members had contributed quite a bit, and I hated the idea of the whole thing being closed off to additional input.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's why I raised this question in meta and that's why I am providing the following answer, for discussion, by the community.  I agree that the site should not be a dumping ground for spam, low quality questions/answers, or product recs.  However, when I think that this kind of question has a lot of community value, maybe not to pro bicyclists or bike shops, but definitely to ordinary folks who are using bicycles in their community. So the fact that the question was rapidly closed without a clear reason why **based on a relevant citation of the site guidelines**, gave me cause to invest a lot of time in this discussion. I want to help the community of maybe not all bicyclists, but maybe of some ordinary bicyclists, people like me who can't spend a lot of money on gear -- to get their questions answered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An example of an appropriate question/answer for this site, to help people in the community of bicycles would be as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Q: How do I fix a flat tire?  My ride is bumpy and my I can see the wheel is getting damage.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A1: Remove the innnertube.  Abrade the puncture and apply a rubber&#xD;&#xA;&gt; glue. Allow to cure and replace the tire.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A2: A1 is good but doesn't address blow outs.  Buy a new innertube. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; You can find them at a bike store, on Amazon or google them.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A3: A1 and A2 are correct but before you do A1 you should also check&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the tire for thorns.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A4: Go to a bicycle store and buy a new wheel, with tire and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; innertube. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The pattern this question follows matches the headlamp question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. It presents a clearly defined problem that might have one or more solutions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Answerers are free to provide a variety of responses, good and bad, that can be up/downvoted by the community.  Even though some answers might be downvoted _they still might be useful for some users._  Answers that are off topic can be voted off by users -- no moderator intervention required.  Answers that are partial can be combined with other answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. When it comes to problem solving, if the requirements are clear, anything that meets the requirements can be a valid solution, provided it has been proven in practice.  That's what separates opinion from fact.  Opinions are about 'the best way' to do something. Facts are 'this is a valid way to do something.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. It is not too broad (question can be answered effectively with the top voted response likely to meet most user's requirements.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. A2 and A3 could be posted as a comments, inviting A1 or A2 to be amended making it an even better answer.  This could be handled by down voting A2/A3 and in comments, asking answerer to submit answer as a comment to A1, with the author of A1 amending the answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. A4 might make sense to someone in a hurry, so though it's weird, it's a valid solution, e.g., it meets the requirements of the problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although the question linked by the original poster involves issues of cost, light output specifications, and detachability, these are making the problem _more specific_ not less.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, what's the problem?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Does it meet the community guidelines?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Specific issues with bicycles.** Yes. A headlamp is part of a bicycle and is on the list of approved tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Specific issues with bicycling.**  Yes. The OP needed a light to deal with Coyotes chasing the bike.  Coyotes are definitely an issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Real problems or questions that you’ve encountered.**  Yes it's a real problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does it violate community guidelines?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Anything not directly related to bicycles or bicycling** No. As stated above, headlamps are in scope.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Questions that are primarily opinion-based** No, note above the definition of what is &quot;opinion&quot; -- a question like &quot;what's the best headlamp for this situation.&quot;  This question merely asks, &quot;how do I get or build a headlamp with these requirements.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Questions with too many possible answers or that would require an extremely long answer** No. This is pretty subjective and might be an area of contention. However, answers can typically be combined through the commenting process. Also, there are unlikely to be too many ways to solve this particular problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In regards to the previous entry in this discussion, a few points:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Existing Problems With The Question&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; In both the original and the edit you say that you have not found a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 300+ lumen light. There are a large number of existing bike lights&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that are 300+ lumens, though I suspect there may be none that run on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; consumer replaceable AA or AAA batteries. Five experienced members of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the community voted to close the question as &quot;Off Topic&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Per site guidelines, I edited the question to bring it on-topic. That's what the site told me to do after it was marked off-topic.  Was the problem here, that I put off the experienced members after I edited it?  Should I have deleted/reposted the question?  No. I've tried that before -- and was wrong.  People have submitted valid information and answers already. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Both those&#xD;&#xA;&gt; votes, and the close note appended to the question provide feedback.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I did not see any feedback that explained 1) why the question was too broad 2) how the question did not apply to bicycles -- headlamps is a valid tag -- or 3) why the question would require an answer of excessive length -- the stated &quot;topic requirements: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There were multiple comments on the original question, and there have&#xD;&#xA;&gt; been multiple comments on the edited question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many of the comments were to present a perspective on community guidelines -- when I saw this I created a post in meta, which is shown as the place to discuss these things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The question didn't&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;keep getting closed&quot; - it accumulated enough votes and was closed&#xD;&#xA;&gt; once.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I originally posted this question using different wording, closed and deleted it (my bad) so that's why I said &quot;keeps getting closed.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Finally - the primary point of the question seems to be &quot;How can&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I build a 300+ lumen light that runs of rechargable NiMH AA or AAA&#xD;&#xA;&gt; batteries.&quot; The fact that you want this to be detachable for a bicycle&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is ancillary to the main question. That question is not a good fit for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; this site, and would be better suited for the Electrical Engineering&#xD;&#xA;&gt; site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main problems -- what components, affixing to the bike, water, detachability, are outside of the realm of electrical engineering site:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a specific electronics design problem &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the theory and simulation of electromagnetic forces &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a communication scheme &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the writing of firmware for bare-metal or RTOS applications&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The way I get it, the EE site is about schematics, mathematical equations and such, by people who have laboratories and machine shops, not about cases or mechanical issues.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I see this has been a summary of points that have also been addressed in my comments, so apologies for any redundancy here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Issues With The Meta Post**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; With all due respect, your tone (hard to gauge in written&#xD;&#xA;&gt; communication, I know. Forgive me if I have misread it...) seems to be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; one of impatience out of whack with a site completely created and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; edited by volunteers:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's fair enough. Always GREAT to get feedback on tone. However, if that's actually a factor in closing the question (and you mentioning it here is why I'm bringing it up) isn't that a little unscientific?  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; It appears that you edited the question, and when it wasn't&#xD;&#xA;&gt; immediately reopened, came here to expreses dissatisfaction and try and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; get a moderator to intervene.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I came here to ask why the question was closed, because, as shown above, the commenters did not clearly show (to me) how the site guidelines were being applied to make the case.  The reason Meta was created in the first place was to avoid this kind of discussion in the content area of the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Again, this post makes it seem like you&#xD;&#xA;&gt; have ignored the feedback given on the original question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Every comment criticizing the post was answered before I created the meta post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;This kind of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; conversation about how to modify a particular question that is getting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; downvotes or has been closed, is best suited for chat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I had already modified the question -- to address all the issues.  So that work was done.  My question **here** is more about 'why do electronic components disqualify a question' or 'why does the fact a question can be solved with an expensive or too-cheap solution disqualify it?'  I'd like to know why **product categories** would be off topic, even if they didn't contain a specific product recs.  Like &quot;there is such a thing as a detachable flashlight mount. Here are some places you can find it.&quot; That's great information for everyone!   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Meta is described as follows, in it's guidelines:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Meta Bicycles Stack Exchange is the part of the site where users&#xD;&#xA;&gt; discuss the workings and policies of Bicycles Stack Exchange rather&#xD;&#xA;&gt; than discussing bicycles itself. It is separated from the main Q&amp;A to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reduce noise there while providing a legitimate space for people to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ask how and why this site works the way it does. Meta is for...&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...Bicycles Stack Exchange users to communicate with each other about&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Bicycles Stack Exchange (asking questions about how the websites work,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or about policies and community decisions) ...Bicycles Stack Exchange&#xD;&#xA;&gt; users to communicate with Stack Overflow the company (posting bugs,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; suggesting improvements, or proposing new features), and ...Stack&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Overflow the company to communicate with the community (soliciting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; feedback on new ideas or features, or discussing policies that affect&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the whole network)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Okay, I am so exhausted here.  But I really am hoping we can open up this site to questions that would be relevant to my situation, the pauper vs. the coyotes. Or, that the guidelines can be changed to more accurately reflect the restrictions.  If I'm wrong, let me know why.  Otherwise, please let's open this back up, so we can reaffirm the values that bring so many people to this site to ask questions helpful to other bicyclists, and to invest our time in giving helpful answers for the benefit of all.&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I can see that, while you're relatively new to Bicycles SE, you have over 30k reputation on Stack Overflow. Try to put yourself in the shoes of a new user who has never encountered the Stack Exchange format. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stack Exchange is a different format than the typical forum that many new users are accustomed to. Users typically make posts like this because they are unaware of how the site works rather than simple carelessness or disregard for our structure. They've bounced around more casually structured forums and, at first glance, this kind of looks like one of those. Typically, they simply need to be told that they're dealing with something a little different and they're happy to oblige.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as your question goes...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You are not missing anything in the user's profile. As it stands, flagging each answer *is* the right way to contact a moderator about a particular user. While it may appear inefficient to a non-mod, there are a couple of good reasons for doing it that way: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The mods have a dashboard where we can see the entire flag history for a user. If it comes to the point of contacting a user directly and/or doling out a suspension, it is very helpful to have a list of the specific pieces of content that don't fit within the site's guidelines.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Flagging and/or commenting on specific answers also helps new users to learn our format, rather than punishing them simply for being an enthusiastic new user who doesn't understand how the site works.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And again, I can't stress enough how much I would prefer for us to mold a new user like this. He or she clearly has some knowledge about bicycles and is very enthusiastic about sharing that knowledge. We are a small site, but would like to grow. We've had users like this in the past who have gone on to become fantastic members of the site. Let's bias ourselves to constructive criticism rather than bringing down the mod hammer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Its that time of year when the seasons change, and we get a flux of new users.  Some &quot;get it&quot; straight away, some never understand how SE works.  And there are always some in the middle who can be great contributors with a little guidance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes these new users are not native English speakers, which adds an extra barrier for them to phrase their thoughts.  So IMO its worth spending a bit of effort to help get the question out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This one... probably won't get there and I'd lay odds it will be closed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In summary - sorry about the reject, was not intentional."

There's a review queue that users with 500+ reputation have access to. Edits show up in the review and users vote on whether or not to accept or reject those edits. A mod *could* unilaterally approve or review or reject an edit, bypassing the review process, but that's not what happened here. This was a perfectly normal community review.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at the history, I can see that two users rejected your edit and one approved. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've looked at your edit and I can sort of see why someone would think those changes weren't an improvement. The text edits that you made are primarily rewording and contain some punctuation and grammar errors. Personally, I probably would have approved it, but I see both sides.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The image is a definite improvement, but it's not super obvious in the queue that the image was added. That's not your fault, it's just the way it is. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As DavidW points out in his comment, the post probably should have been closed anyway. (I've done that.) It's fairly likely that people looked at it and didn't want to take the time to improve your edit it because unclear what the OP was asking and possibly off topic anyway.&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

What is notable though is that the members who rejected the edit also voted to close the question as unclear. So perhaps despite your edit they were still not sure what the question even was, therefore how meaningful the edit was, so held back on the editing process before/anticipating further input from the OP. Meanwhile, along came Criggie who felt he had a little more of a handle on the question so could see the value in both editing and answering the question as it was, with an edit much like your own.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully you won't be put off by the rejection, I empathise and remember it can be frustrating when you are acting sincerely. You made a positive contribution with the edit, its a bit of bad luck timing wise that it was not approved. On the bright side it won't be long before you have enough reputation to make edits without needing approval and this will be water under the bridge. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep on suggesting edits like you have done, if they're genuine then the majority will be approved and it will help boost your rep by a little bit each time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If there are cyclists not quite understanding what it is without explanation, then we shouldn't expect the network at large to realise it either. That said, I do think that it falls on the one who wants a change, to come up with an idea that people like more than the current one. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the most successful icons I can see are the chef's hat of Seasoned Advice, the piggy bank of Personal Finance and Money, and maybe the planet icon of Worldbuilding. They're successful because as someone who isn't active on those sites, I see the icon and have an idea of what it's about even before I examine further. I think ours is less successful on the intuitive-ness scale, but I wouldn't change it unless something was put forward that was up there with the best ones, it needs to be intuitive or there's little point in making any change.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't love the thought of making it a straight bicycle logo, but equally, what says 'bicycles' better than an image of one?

But… oops, where did the time go? It’s already March! Belated as it is, it’s time for a refresh of **Community Promotion Ads**!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### What are Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&#xD;&#xA; - If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1391" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Imagine the user who will never read your FAQ and you have two seconds to grab their attention. It should be catchy but descriptive. It should be thoroughly clear but painfully concise. **Make every... word... count.** &#xA;&#xA;Here are some creative examples: &#xA;&#xA;- [Gawker](http://gawker.com/): Daily Manhattan media news and gossip. Reporting live from the center of the universe. &#xA;- [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/): The gadget guide. So much in love with shiny new toys, it’s unnatural. &#xA;- [Autoblog](http://www.autoblog.com/): We obsessively cover the auto industry. &#xA;- [DumbLittleMan](http://www.dumblittleman.com/): So what do we do here? Well, it’s simple. 15 to 20 times per week we provide tips that will save you money, increase your productivity, or simply keep you sane. &#xA;- [Needcoffee.com](http://www.needcoffee.com/): We are the Internet equivalent of a triple espresso with whipped cream. Mmmm…whipped cream. &#xA;- [QBP](http://www.qbp.com/): QBP is the shop behind America’s bicycle shops.&#xA;&#xA;## Use it as a Tagline &#xA;&#xA;A shorter elevator pitch *can* be used as a tagline&amp;thinsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;thinsp;something you can display in the header at the top of the page. If it doesn't fit, consider shortening it or creating a separate tagline. Here are some great examples: &#xA;&#xA;- [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/): News for nerds. Stuff that matters. &#xA;- [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/): Don’t live to geek, geek to live! &#xA;- [The Simple Dollar](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/): Financial talk for the rest of us. &#xA;- [Trek](http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/company/believe/): We believe in bikes.&#xA;- [Bike Friday](http://www.bikefriday.com/): Performance that packs.&#xA;- [Co-Motion Cycles](http://co-motion.com/): American made, Oregon made, handmade.&#xA;- [League of American Bicycles](http://www.bikeleague.org/): Working for a Bicycle Friendly America.&#xA;&#xA;## The Motto (don't forget your logo) &#xA;&#xA;A logo begs for it own little, short tagline&amp;thinsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;thinsp;like a motto. Maybe the tagline inspires the logo; Maybe it's the other way around. Mottos make good t-shirt, bumper stickers, and other marketing material. Either way, you'll recognize a good motto when you see it: &#xA;&#xA;- Just do it. &#xA;- Think Different. &#xA;- The Uncola. &#xA;- Intel inside. &#xA;- Like a rock. &#xA;- The king of beers. &#xA;&#xA;&amp;hellip;and perhaps all this leads to a proper name and domain for your site&amp;hellip; *eventually*.

I think that, as far as bikes are concerned, you should take note of how much more sophisticated and high-tech bikes are than anything else on the roads. Carbon fibre is commonplace on bikes, not so on cars, they are stuck on steel and only just dabbling with aluminium which is old-tech for bikes. Bikes also can have electronic gears and time-trial machines use every aerodynamic trick in the wind-tunnel-hand-book. Fabrics for cycle clothing are also light years ahead of anything in the High Street or catwalk. LED lights were pioneered on bikes and are just making their way onto cars. Put simply, although we all have childhood memories of cycling, cycling is essentially a high-tech game with nothing vintage about it.&#xA;&#xA;'Solo cyclist'&#xA;&#xA;I have been out and about on the bike today and I could not help but notice how many people were cycling in groups. When it is sunny weather it seems there are more people in groups than going solo. I think that the site is about community and that could be reflected by a diverse selection of riders on different styles of bikes. Inclusiveness is part of what the questions and answers are about.&#xA;&#xA;Why Off-road?&#xA;&#xA;The majority of questions on the site seem to be from people that ride for a mix of utility and pleasure. I personally view off-road mountain-biking as a bit 1980's, nowadays bikes are to be found in the city and along canal towpaths rather than off-road, as was the fashion when the 'car was king'.&#xA;&#xA;What is wrong with sky blue skies?&#xA;&#xA;Call me picky, but I like blue skies to be blue. Can we experiment with some different gradients? 'Simpsons' title sequence has a blue sky that is blue sky colour, as does the view out of my window now. There are lots of blues that say sky, I am just not feeling it with this one.&#xA;&#xA;Heart Logo and buttons&#xA;&#xA;I like the heart logo, however I feel we could do a bit more with the existing bicycle road sign colour palette. Around here (UK) we have signs in blue, e.g:&#xA;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xA;&#xA;With road signs red means stop, take attention, hazard ahead and so forth. Green has its own meanings, however, for bikes that is the colour of a cycle lane, i.e. the tarmac is painted green. I feel we already have a few colours that can be made to work with the design.&#xA;&#xA;For instance, the heart might work really well if in green. This will mean that the favicon does not look like some dating site or my little pony site. This may appease the naysayers.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Randomly thrown in ideas&#xA;&#xA;I am an admire of the cycle artwork that goes with 'Critical Mass' rather than Tour-de-France wannabee-ism, as you get in 'Future Publishing' style magazines. Andy Singer's series was excellent as were Ken Avidor's 'Road Kill Bill' cartoons that could be found in 'Carbusters' magazine a decade ago when it was underground, edgy and subversive.&#xA;&#xA;The site is also a global affair the sphere-style hills could have some cartoon-ified coastlines that are notionally of continents. We could play with some ideas of scale.&#xA;&#xA;I was impressed by the UK train adverts that Virgin put out a while back. We could do something similar with bicycles going overhead of gridlocked traffic, maybe doing the black and white grey for the cars and true technicolor for the bikes:&#xA;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xA;&#xA;![enter image description here][3]&#xA;&#xA;And finally... &#xA;&#xA;We haven't decided on a strap line, 'It is about the bike!' might work as a working title rather than 'lorem ipsrubbish' that designers pretend to work with. &#xA;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/RiAxK.jpg&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/y8deg.jpg&#xA;  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/DYqIH.jpg" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Congratulations.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family.&#xA;&#xA;The HTML.&#xA;&#xA;# Why&#xA;&gt; During the brainstorming phase, I asked myself, why do people ride bicycles if they have a choice of driving a car, or why do they choose cycling if there are other forms of exercise?&#xA;&#xA;When I was offered a job in a further-away office I thought, &quot;I'm either going to have to move apartments: again. Or, get a faster bike: to go the further distance.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;I now commute an hour each way, by bike. It's regular exercise, because it's commuting (though I might also do it if I had the leisure).&#xA;&#xA;I think that the motivation, of many [men](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/3335) at least, is to go fast and far.&#xA;&#xA;There are several categories of biking:&#xA;&#xA;* Road (racing, training, touring)&#xA;* Off-road (trails)&#xA;* Hybrid (urban, leisure, utility)&#xA;* And others: recumbents, children, cargo, trendy bikes.&#xA;&#xA;[Bicycles - Stack Exchange is for people who build and repair bicycles, people who train cycling, or commute on bicycles.](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/faq)&#xA; &#xA;# Myself&#xA;&gt; As a one-time bicycle lover myself, I thought about personal freedom, accessibility, low cost and being in touch with the great outdoors.&#xA;&#xA;Yes my first bike was the first time I left my neighbourhood alone, to go exploring. It is relatively cheap.&#xA;&#xA;And the outdoors are great (I don't know how people manage 'exercise bikes' and 'trainers' indoors: I get warm and want a fan). Outside there's always as good a breeze as you're willing to cycle into.&#xA;&#xA;It can be, is, easier than walking.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; So for the design, I wanted to capture the feeling of riding a bike, rather than focusing on the bike as an object.&#xA;&#xA;## Feeling of riding a bike&#xA;The feeling of riding a bike, for me, is:&#xA;&#xA;* Brighter than in-doors (or darker at night and winter)&#xA;* Balance (shoes and pedals)&#xA;* Acceleration (setting off, little effort at low speeds, up-shifting)&#xA;* Gliding (coasting or free-wheeling)&#xA;* Smooth (cycling feet)&#xA;* Faster heart and deeper breathing&#xA;&#xA;The reality is:&#xA;&#xA;* 20+ mph (32+ kph)&#xA;* Top speed limited by wind resistance: so it's like flying&#xA;* $1500 for a new commuting bike with accessories and free service costs less than the public transit fares for a year&#xA;* A year-round commute is feasible: I've easily ridden in -8C through +38C (17F through 100F) temperatures for an hour each way, every weekday (except about 10 days for rain and wind and health) since March 2011, wearing basic cotton clothing and gloves (and sunscreen) etc. Winter is warm, and summer is cool (there's a breeze).&#xA;&#xA;There's the practical, commuting 20 km in an hour. One can cross the city about as fast on a bike as by bus and subway and tram/streetcar.&#xA;&#xA;In a couple of hours of cycling you can burn 1000 calories. Pre-hydrate.&#xA;&#xA;Other people post on the forum about road bikes/races, and about off-road mountain biking.&#xA;&#xA;## Focusing on the bike as an object&#xA;&#xA;A major purpose of the site is to Q+A about bikes as objects (here's an [interesting advertisement](http://vimeo.com/18472550)).&#xA;&#xA;Tires. Brakes. Gloves. Bearings. Parts. Traffic skills. Maintenance.&#xA;&#xA;# Art style&#xA;&gt; Riding a bicycle is a very personal and independent choice. I wanted the design to reflect that. I believe a hand illustrated art style gives it a more personal touch, and the slightly vintage treatment makes it more timeless.&#xA;&#xA;A poster is better than a photo which could get old.&#xA;&#xA;SF is another way to make a timeless treatment (Bruce Sterling's novelette [Bicycle Repairman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_Repairman) won the Hugo).&#xA;&#xA;# Been around for a long time&#xA;&gt; After all, bicycles have been around for a long time.&#xA;&#xA;Been around, eh? Know what I mean?&#xA;&#xA;Mine's fairly new, and maintained. It's better than my previous one which was new for $130 two years ago (and which is fine for an easy cycle half an hour and back: I lend it for riding to the swimming pool).&#xA;&#xA;The bikes people write about are often new or used, and are usually not department store bikes.&#xA;&#xA;You might find modern bikes surprisingly light and fast.&#xA;&#xA;# Poster&#xA;&gt; Since the design is entirely focused on a &quot;feeling,&quot; I decided to design a poster for our bicycles site first.&#xA;&#xA;Nice poster.&#xA;&#xA;You should see [Neil Fein's awesome flyer](https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/311/flyers-for-people-to-use/312#312).&#xA;&#xA;&gt; That way, I didn't have the distraction of the constraints I normally face when creating a design for the web.&#xA;&#xA;Good.&#xA;&#xA;Off-topic do you have a reading list to recommend? About design?&#xA;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Rycp.jpg&quot;&gt;![Bicycles Poster][2]&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&#xA;In the picture above I'd like to see a narrower white line, to make the lanes wider. I'm glad to see you've already done that in the current design.&#xA;&#xA;The above reminds me of Normandy.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Above is the poster I came up with. I believe the texture, color scheme and minimalist style work towards the goal I was aiming for. From there I transfered the visual elements onto the site design.&#xA;&gt; Please keep in mind, not all of the site elements are present in these two mockups.&#xA;&#xA;Ads. And you're showing the header and the footer on the same fold.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; I incorporated some visuals related to bicycles and cycling, e.g. road signs and cogs. But I was careful to not to make it overly &quot;themey.&quot; Also, I tried to fit all of the design in one image, so it looks busier than the live site will be.&#xA;&gt; I'm pleased with the overall design. It did capture the feel I was going after. The site has a unique identity, while maintaining the feeling of the Stack Exchange family. &#xA;&gt; I'd love to hear your feedback. If there are no major design changes, I'm aiming to launch the site next Tuesday. So an early congrats from me!&#xA;&#xA;Cheers.&#xA;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/our-designer-in-residence-jin-yang/&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Rycp.jpg" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Anyone want to tackle a blog post on bike lanes *designed* for wrong-way cycling? (I've been on a few of them.) &#xA;&#xA;From the answer: &#xA;&#xA;&gt; The issue is actually quite complex. Some &quot;wrong-way&quot; routes can be quite safe if well-designed, marked, and implemented. Much of the data and research in this area is in French because &quot;contresens pistes cyclable&quot; have been implemented in several French cities such as Paris, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, and Lyon, among others. In addition, a few other countries have implemented similar bike ways, such as Belgium, Switzerland, Japan, and the Netherlands. In general, these &quot;counter-direction&quot; bikeways are in dense urban areas with many narrow one-way streets and restricted speed limits (usually, 30 to 40 km/h, or around 20 to 25 mph). A 200 page report from the Institut Federatif de Recherche sur Les Economies et Les Societes Indutrielles (one of the French research institutes) of the experiences in 5 French cities can be found [here][1] (in French) and a short PowerPoint presentation by the lead author of that study can be found [here][2] (again, in French). No accidents were observed on contresens bikeways in the study area during the period from 2002-6. A two-page illustrated brochure advocating the expansion of contresens urban pistes can be found [here][3]. &#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; On a personal note, I was surprised when a contresens piste cyclable was marked on my narow one-way street in Paris. I initially thought it to be suicidal but after riding on it for two blocks I understood why it could be safer: a study of **every** bicycle fatality in Paris in 2005 had shown that the single largest cause of death was being right-hooked at intersections, and the contresens bikeways completely eliminated this danger.&#xA;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.fubicy.org/spip.php?article157&#xA;  [2]: http://www.fubicy.org/avon/moret/Moret/Contresens%20VaV.ppt&#xA;  [3]: http://www.droitauvelo.org/DOC/FICHES/fiche1.pdf" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

(Since you're not citing specific examples, I'm answering this in a broad, general way. If I'm covering stuff you're very familiar with, I apologize if it comes across as lecturing or talking down; that's not my intent.) &#xA;&#xA;## Background&#xA;&#xA;Stack Exchange sites are not web forums, whose job is to encourage a happy community that will come back and keep the site running through ad impressions. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh, but it's true. The purpose of a Stack Exchange Q&amp;A site is not to provide a forum for people's questions, or even to help people. The purpose of Stack Exchange is to make the internet a better, more curated place, with lists of on-topic questions where the community votes the best answers to the top of the page. We want to ask and answer questions so well that when you Google &quot;How do I fix [problem] on my [type of bike]&quot;, that Stack Exchange question is the first hit on Google. Furthermore, we want to be viewed as a *reliable* resource. (That last is very important.)&#xA;&#xA;## Closing&#xA;&#xA;Communities are provided with the **close and delete mechanisms** to ensure that questions that are off-topic, or unanswerable (i.e., can't be answered definitively and voted on) will be removed from the site. Closing a question disallows further answers, so the question can be edited. If the question is beyond saving, it can be deleted. Of course, individuals will disagree on what questions are good ones. This helps make the question more reliably answerable with answers that can be voted on. &#xA;&#xA;Closing is not unfriendly, nor is it malicious. Think of editing a letter: Would you want to edit a letter as the replies came in? Of course not, you'd want to edit it before it's sent out. Similarly, it's worth noting that, when borderline or problematic questions are closed *quickly*, they can be edited with a freer hand than if they're left open. If they're left open, answers pile up, then it makes it harder to edit the question into a good one. &quot;What bike should I get&quot; may be edited to &quot;What features should I get in a winter commuter bike&quot;. If the more general question is answered, it's a waste of everybody's time.  &#xA;&#xA;## Voting&#xA;&#xA;In order to encourage good content and discourage bad content, users are also provided with the **upvote and downvote mechanisms**. Upvoting good content is a way of telling the system, &quot;this person does good stuff here. We can trust them.&quot; Similarly, misinformation needs to be voted down, or the site will fill with it over time. Downvoting is a deterrent that needs to be exercised or Stack Exchange won't work. &#xA;&#xA;Now, to the meat of this: Leaving feedback when downvoting is undeniably helpful. Downvoting someone's question or answer without explaining why leaves them to guess at why they were downvoted. It feels like a slap, getting a downvote like that. Requiring users to leave a comment while downvoting has been discussed on Meta.SO. However, filling out a comment to fill out a comment seems pointless, and it's important to preserve [voter anonymity](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/27534/see-who-is-upvoting-downvoting-my-question-answer). &#xA;&#xA;As long as most users are leaving constructive feedback, I think we'll be fine. Drive-by downvoting is, as far as I can see, the exception and not the rule.  &#xA;&#xA;## Summary &#xA;&#xA;&gt; If the downvoting and enforcement is just the random acts of trolls...&#xA;&#xA;It's easy to feel this way when you see a question closed. And I would agree that responsible downvoting and closing should be accompanied with comments explaining how the question can be improved, or it's worthless. (However, I also feel that anonymous downvoting is desirable. But that's another discussion.) &#xA;&#xA;If you feel that &quot;enforcing&quot; is a bad thing, perhaps Stack Exchange isn't for you. This is not a feee-for-all discussion forum, it's a place meant to generate good, worthwhile, structured content that will improve the internet. People who downvote and close questions are absolutely required, and calling them &quot;trolls&quot; dismisses their contributions to the site. They are encouraging good content by taking these actions. Rather than worry about the few anonymous downvoters, simply encourage constructive feeback by listening and responding to it. And viewing closing as an opportunity to edit and re-open will result in better questions and answers. " ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This summer's events will be taking place once a month from May - September, with one event in each of the city's 5 quadrants*. The routes each include several city parks, which are hubs for community activities during the event. Each event often has over 20,000 participants. Overall, the 2011 Sunday Parkways had 107,300 participants across all days/locations.&#xA;&#xA;Parkways requires a massive number of volunteers to be successful: each intersection needs a volunteer to make sure that unauthorized vehicles don't get onto the route, and to help neighbors who live on the route get into and out of their driveways. &#xA;&#xA;This year, PBOT is doing something new: [a group of people can volunteer to &quot;adopt&quot; an intersection][1] on the route.&#xA;&#xA;# I want Bicycles Stack Exchange to adopt an intersection and&lt;br/&gt; promote Stack Exchange at the May 12th Sunday Parkways event!&#xA;&#xA;&gt; We invite you and your organization to “own” an intersection of a Portland Sunday Parkways event.  You have the opportunity to bring your cause to life to over 20,000 event participants.&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; - You make the intersection as exciting and inviting as you want. &#xA;&gt; - You have a space for a canopy and a table.  Do what you can to entice people to hear your message as they are enjoying the open Sunday Parkways streets.&#xA;&gt; - Bring along a team of volunteers, staff members, supporters and maybe a big mascot.  Cheering people on the course is fun and gets their attention.&#xA;&gt; - People love freebies.  Hand out healthy snacks. Let them make their own Sunday Parkways art.  Take their photo.  Create a reason for people to stop their bikes and engage with you.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;May is National Bike to Work Month, and **we're [hoping to have an awesome site contest][2] to celebrate** and get more people interested in the site. Having a booth at the May Sunday Parkways event would be a great chance to promote the site. Here are some of the specifics:&#xA;&#xA;**When and where:**&#xA;&#xA; - Sunday, May 12th, 2013 in East Portland&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  ([Details][3]) &amp;nbsp;([Map][4])&#xA; - The event is from 11am-4pm. If enough people sign up, we can do shifts. I'll be there for the whole day!&#xA;&#xA;**Who:**&#xA;&#xA; - I will be in Portland, and can be our contact person/coordinator&#xA; - A few local site members have already expressed interest in helping out. I'm planning to recruit some more.&#xA;&#xA;**What to have at our booth:**&#xA;&#xA; - I own a canopy and a portable table that we can probably use&#xA;&#xA; - If somebody has some sort of portable internet connection (phone/tablet with tethering, WiMax, whatever) then we can set up a laptop to show people the site. There won't be any power, but my laptop has about 8 hours of battery life, which should be plenty.&#xA;&#xA; - [Stack Exchange swag][5]! Including Bicycles.SE t-shirts, water bottles, pens, stickers, etc!

Because of that, if flag reasons are wrong, the flag may get declined, even if there's something else wrong with the post. It's helpful to pick the right flag reasons, and to use the custom text when none of the reasons is right.&#xA;&#xA;Moderators (on a non-beta SE site) are here to enforce the clear community consensus. Because of that, if a post is borderline, there are no close votes and there is only one flag, we may decide not to do anything (though in that case we should mark the flag as helpful). We may simply let the flag sit for a bit to give other users a chance to vote to close or flag the post. It's better if a post is closed by several users instead of just one moderator.&#xA;&#xA;If you have the rep to close vote, you should do that on posts you think should be closed. Some mods will even decline a flag asking for a close if the flagger has the rep to close vote and didn't.&#xA;&#xA;## Specifics of this post:&#xA;&#xA;That post is about the laws around bicycling. Specifically, about a detail of the legal status of bicycles on the road. We've [decided that bicycling legal questions are on topic](https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/755/are-law-questions-ok). Therefore this question is clearly on topic.&#xA;&#xA;Your point about practical, answerable questions would be a *not constructive* close reason, not an *off topic* close reason.&#xA;&#xA;That question doesn't appear to be *not constructive* to me, either. The only flaw I see is that it would be better scoped to a reasonable legal jurisdiction (country or state/province in a country), since laws are very different between countries.&#xA;&#xA;It's definitely an *answerable* question. Either quoting the relevant laws, giving reasons for why the laws are written that way, or talking about the history behind those laws.&#xA;&#xA;It's not immediately obvious what the *practical* use is, but it's easy enough to imagine many. Understanding what the bicycling laws are and why they are that way can influence specific riding behavior, and is important background for anybody involved in bicycling advocacy."

The question is to solve a problem of needing a low cost headlamp to scare away wildlife (coyotes) who have been bothering the rider and his dog. It is certainly of value to the original poster and of general value to those who ride at night in wild areas.&#xA;&#xA;I am going to the time to dissect this because, as a member of the StackExchange community and new member of this site, I believe that this question is being unfairly excluded, at least according to the written guidelines provided with the site.  The question has had some good, valuable ideas and answers, community members had contributed quite a bit, and I hated the idea of the whole thing being closed off to additional input.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;That's why I raised this question in meta and that's why I am providing the following answer, for discussion, by the community.  I agree that the site should not be a dumping ground for spam, low quality questions/answers, or product recs.  However, when I think that this kind of question has a lot of community value, maybe not to pro bicyclists or bike shops, but definitely to ordinary folks who are using bicycles in their community. So the fact that the question was rapidly closed without a clear reason why **based on a relevant citation of the site guidelines**, gave me cause to invest a lot of time in this discussion. I want to help the community of maybe not all bicyclists, but maybe of some ordinary bicyclists, people like me who can't spend a lot of money on gear -- to get their questions answered.&#xA;&#xA;An example of an appropriate question/answer for this site, to help people in the community of bicycles would be as follows:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Q: How do I fix a flat tire?  My ride is bumpy and my I can see the wheel is getting damage.&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; A1: Remove the innnertube.  Abrade the puncture and apply a rubber&#xA;&gt; glue. Allow to cure and replace the tire.&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; A2: A1 is good but doesn't address blow outs.  Buy a new innertube. &#xA;&gt; You can find them at a bike store, on Amazon or google them.&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; A3: A1 and A2 are correct but before you do A1 you should also check&#xA;&gt; the tire for thorns.&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; A4: Go to a bicycle store and buy a new wheel, with tire and&#xA;&gt; innertube. &#xA;&#xA;The pattern this question follows matches the headlamp question:&#xA;&#xA;1. It presents a clearly defined problem that might have one or more solutions.&#xA;&#xA;2. Answerers are free to provide a variety of responses, good and bad, that can be up/downvoted by the community.  Even though some answers might be downvoted _they still might be useful for some users._  Answers that are off topic can be voted off by users -- no moderator intervention required.  Answers that are partial can be combined with other answers.&#xA;&#xA;3. When it comes to problem solving, if the requirements are clear, anything that meets the requirements can be a valid solution, provided it has been proven in practice.  That's what separates opinion from fact.  Opinions are about 'the best way' to do something. Facts are 'this is a valid way to do something.'&#xA;&#xA;4. It is not too broad (question can be answered effectively with the top voted response likely to meet most user's requirements.) &#xA;&#xA;5. A2 and A3 could be posted as a comments, inviting A1 or A2 to be amended making it an even better answer.  This could be handled by down voting A2/A3 and in comments, asking answerer to submit answer as a comment to A1, with the author of A1 amending the answer.&#xA;&#xA;6. A4 might make sense to someone in a hurry, so though it's weird, it's a valid solution, e.g., it meets the requirements of the problem.&#xA;&#xA;Although the question linked by the original poster involves issues of cost, light output specifications, and detachability, these are making the problem _more specific_ not less.  &#xA;&#xA;So, what's the problem?&#xA;&#xA;**Does it meet the community guidelines?**&#xA;&#xA;**Specific issues with bicycles.** Yes. A headlamp is part of a bicycle and is on the list of approved tags.&#xA;&#xA;**Specific issues with bicycling.**  Yes. The OP needed a light to deal with Coyotes chasing the bike.  Coyotes are definitely an issue.&#xA;&#xA;**Real problems or questions that you’ve encountered.**  Yes it's a real problem.&#xA;&#xA;Does it violate community guidelines?&#xA;&#xA;**Anything not directly related to bicycles or bicycling** No. As stated above, headlamps are in scope.&#xA;&#xA;**Questions that are primarily opinion-based** No, note above the definition of what is &quot;opinion&quot; -- a question like &quot;what's the best headlamp for this situation.&quot;  This question merely asks, &quot;how do I get or build a headlamp with these requirements.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;**Questions with too many possible answers or that would require an extremely long answer** No. This is pretty subjective and might be an area of contention. However, answers can typically be combined through the commenting process. Also, there are unlikely to be too many ways to solve this particular problem.&#xA;&#xA;In regards to the previous entry in this discussion, a few points:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Existing Problems With The Question&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; In both the original and the edit you say that you have not found a&#xA;&gt; 300+ lumen light. There are a large number of existing bike lights&#xA;&gt; that are 300+ lumens, though I suspect there may be none that run on&#xA;&gt; consumer replaceable AA or AAA batteries. Five experienced members of&#xA;&gt; the community voted to close the question as &quot;Off Topic&quot;. &#xA;&#xA;Per site guidelines, I edited the question to bring it on-topic. That's what the site told me to do after it was marked off-topic.  Was the problem here, that I put off the experienced members after I edited it?  Should I have deleted/reposted the question?  No. I've tried that before -- and was wrong.  People have submitted valid information and answers already. &#xA;&#xA;&gt; Both those&#xA;&gt; votes, and the close note appended to the question provide feedback.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I did not see any feedback that explained 1) why the question was too broad 2) how the question did not apply to bicycles -- headlamps is a valid tag -- or 3) why the question would require an answer of excessive length -- the stated &quot;topic requirements: &#xA;&#xA;&gt; There were multiple comments on the original question, and there have&#xA;&gt; been multiple comments on the edited question. &#xA;&#xA;Many of the comments were to present a perspective on community guidelines -- when I saw this I created a post in meta, which is shown as the place to discuss these things.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; The question didn't&#xA;&gt; &quot;keep getting closed&quot; - it accumulated enough votes and was closed&#xA;&gt; once.&#xA;&#xA;I originally posted this question using different wording, closed and deleted it (my bad) so that's why I said &quot;keeps getting closed.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Finally - the primary point of the question seems to be &quot;How can&#xA;&gt; I build a 300+ lumen light that runs of rechargable NiMH AA or AAA&#xA;&gt; batteries.&quot; The fact that you want this to be detachable for a bicycle&#xA;&gt; is ancillary to the main question. That question is not a good fit for&#xA;&gt; this site, and would be better suited for the Electrical Engineering&#xA;&gt; site. &#xA;&#xA;The main problems -- what components, affixing to the bike, water, detachability, are outside of the realm of electrical engineering site:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; a specific electronics design problem &#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; the theory and simulation of electromagnetic forces &#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; a communication scheme &#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; the writing of firmware for bare-metal or RTOS applications&#xA;&#xA;The way I get it, the EE site is about schematics, mathematical equations and such, by people who have laboratories and machine shops, not about cases or mechanical issues.&#xA;&#xA;I see this has been a summary of points that have also been addressed in my comments, so apologies for any redundancy here.&#xA;&#xA;**Issues With The Meta Post**&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; With all due respect, your tone (hard to gauge in written&#xA;&gt; communication, I know. Forgive me if I have misread it...) seems to be&#xA;&gt; one of impatience out of whack with a site completely created and&#xA;&gt; edited by volunteers:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;That's fair enough. Always GREAT to get feedback on tone. However, if that's actually a factor in closing the question (and you mentioning it here is why I'm bringing it up) isn't that a little unscientific?  &#xA;&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; It appears that you edited the question, and when it wasn't&#xA;&gt; immediately reopened, came here to expreses dissatisfaction and try and&#xA;&gt; get a moderator to intervene.&#xA;&#xA;I came here to ask why the question was closed, because, as shown above, the commenters did not clearly show (to me) how the site guidelines were being applied to make the case.  The reason Meta was created in the first place was to avoid this kind of discussion in the content area of the site.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Again, this post makes it seem like you&#xA;&gt; have ignored the feedback given on the original question. &#xA;&#xA;Every comment criticizing the post was answered before I created the meta post.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;This kind of&#xA;&gt; conversation about how to modify a particular question that is getting&#xA;&gt; downvotes or has been closed, is best suited for chat.&#xA;&#xA;I had already modified the question -- to address all the issues.  So that work was done.  My question **here** is more about 'why do electronic components disqualify a question' or 'why does the fact a question can be solved with an expensive or too-cheap solution disqualify it?'  I'd like to know why **product categories** would be off topic, even if they didn't contain a specific product recs.  Like &quot;there is such a thing as a detachable flashlight mount. Here are some places you can find it.&quot; That's great information for everyone!   &#xA;&#xA;Meta is described as follows, in it's guidelines:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Meta Bicycles Stack Exchange is the part of the site where users&#xA;&gt; discuss the workings and policies of Bicycles Stack Exchange rather&#xA;&gt; than discussing bicycles itself. It is separated from the main Q&amp;A to&#xA;&gt; reduce noise there while providing a legitimate space for people to&#xA;&gt; ask how and why this site works the way it does. Meta is for...&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; ...Bicycles Stack Exchange users to communicate with each other about&#xA;&gt; Bicycles Stack Exchange (asking questions about how the websites work,&#xA;&gt; or about policies and community decisions) ...Bicycles Stack Exchange&#xA;&gt; users to communicate with Stack Overflow the company (posting bugs,&#xA;&gt; suggesting improvements, or proposing new features), and ...Stack&#xA;&gt; Overflow the company to communicate with the community (soliciting&#xA;&gt; feedback on new ideas or features, or discussing policies that affect&#xA;&gt; the whole network)&#xA;&#xA;Okay, I am so exhausted here.  But I really am hoping we can open up this site to questions that would be relevant to my situation, the pauper vs. the coyotes. Or, that the guidelines can be changed to more accurately reflect the restrictions.  If I'm wrong, let me know why.  Otherwise, please let's open this back up, so we can reaffirm the values that bring so many people to this site to ask questions helpful to other bicyclists, and to invest our time in giving helpful answers for the benefit of all.&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Mainstream manufacturers may offer nickel or other coatings on their higher-level cassettes to *decrease* friction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One counterargument is that there's a clear, if small, market for ceramic bearings on high-end performance bikes.

It currently has no usage guidance. It overlaps substantively with other tags. Edit: should we remove the ceramic tag?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is rarely used, which may indicate that it's of limited utility. Of the 7 current questions with this tag:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - 2 relate to ceramic (or PEO) coatings on rim brake rims. First, this arguably falls under questions related to rims or to brakes. Second, this is not a common feature even in high-performance alloy rims. It is not likely to become so, because performance bikes are evolving to use disc brakes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - 4 relate to ceramic bearings. These should fall under the tag for bearings anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The last one refers to a ceramic coating on a cassette. Some of these cassettes exist, but they aren't offered by mainstream manufacturers. Ceramic coating is actually relatively rough at a microscopic level. I suspect they would *increase* drivetrain friction. Mainstream manufacturers may offer nickel or other coatings on their higher-level cassettes to *decrease* friction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One counterargument is that there's a clear, if small, market for ceramic bearings on high-end performance bikes. Removing the tag might make it harder for users to find questions related to ceramic bearings, or ceramic other stuff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ceramic" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Comments which are conversational are never appropriate, as clearly called out in the flagging UI (&quot;outdated, **conversational**, or not relevant&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This guidance is reiterated by a current site moderator in [What if comments on answers start to grow and look like a forum?][2], a Q&amp;A posted nine years ago but which appears just as relevant and applicable today as it was when it was first posted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And yet, when I make an attempt to help improve the site by flagging comments that are no longer needed (and indeed, in most cases should never have been posted in the first place), these flags are often declined. I've let most slide, but the other day an entire group of flags were declined on comments that are egregiously inappropriate and clearly fall into the &quot;No Longer Needed&quot; category. See the comments below [How bad is switching derailleur gears under load?][3], starting with [_&quot;I have heard that moon is made of cheese and water drips upwards.&quot;_][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Really? A moderator on this site, with the charge to enforce community rules and take action when content violates those rules, made the decision that _&quot;I have heard that moon is made of cheese and water drips upwards&quot;_ not only contributes something constructive, but is such an important contribution that even after the author the post where the comment was posted has read it, the comment needs to remain for posterity?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am frankly a bit shocked at the latitude moderators on this site take toward preserving comments. The approach taken is drastically different from that I see on other sites in the Stack Exchange network (and of course, especially on Stack Overflow, arguably the model for all other sites). This results in an inordinate amount of clutter under many posts, making it difficult to identify the useful information hidden among all the weeds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### The question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why were the flags on these comments declined, what value is it that the moderator felt overrides the normal handling of comments, and assuming this is actually an official policy for this particular Stack Exchange site, where is this departure from the otherwise-standard guidelines documented for this site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/privileges/comment&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/600/what-if-comments-on-answers-start-to-grow-and-look-like-a-forum&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/76570/how-bad-is-switching-derailleur-gears-under-load&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/76570/how-bad-is-switching-derailleur-gears-under-load#comment180313_76570" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Is there a better way to handle these types of questions? For example, we could have a policy where one person comments that &quot;product recs are not allowed here, but you may edit the question to be more generalized so it **can** be answered&quot;, and then any further commenting or answering is prohibited until the question is &quot;fixed&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The current practice of &quot;answering regardless of the rules&quot; or writing an answer on a generalized interpretation of the question simply encourages more people to ask these kinds of questions because they  almost always receive product rec answers regardless.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apologies if this sounded like a rant, and I hope nobody felt personally guilty of perpetrating this behavior.

My reasoning was two-part, but fairly straight forward:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) The comments were less than a day old when they were flagged. This was the primary factor in my decision to reject the flags. Had they been flagged when the question was no longer active, I likely would have deleted them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) I try to use a light touch when using my moderation powers. I prefer to let high reputation users do most of the moderation work and address only the most obvious or egregious moderation issues myself. This is consistent with Stack Exchange's [Theory of Moderation][1]. Deleting an entire conversation that was active and less than a day old goes against that philosophy. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Expanding on this somewhat and addressing your other points...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;The moon is made of cheese&quot; comment is more relevant than I think you're giving it credit for. The point is that hearing something somewhere should be taken with a grain of salt. It's a relevant point within the discussion. Several other comments are humorous, but also contributed relevant opinions to the conversation - the jokes about shifting under load creating thermonuclear events, for example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You mention Stack Overflow as *the* model for the entire Stack Exchange network. This is a mistake. The various Stack Exchange sites are meant to function as independent communities. That's why they have site-specific help pages, meta sites, and moderators. The vast difference in size between sites is one area where the need for independence is both evident and relevant to this particular question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The sheer size of Stack Overflow means that it requires a heavier hand in moderation. The traffic on SO is literally *thousands* of times greater than Bicycles. Taking a light approach in moderation there would result in the site simply becoming unusable. Contrast that with Bicycles where a light approach in moderation might leave an thread a little cumbersome, but that's the extent of it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's further noteworthy that the heavy-handed approach is not without cost. Stack Overflow, and the SE network at large, has an [image problem][2] that is due, at least in part, to its heavy-handed moderation. On a smaller site, such as Bicycles, it's better to prioritize friendliness and community over strict rule enforcement. In this particular case, that meant leaving comments up while the question is active so that the community could bond over a little fun. The comments can always be cleaned up later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, you state in a comment on Criggie's answer that it should be very rare for a NLN flag to be declined. While I don't entirely agree with that statement, it is, indeed, very rare that I decline them. For the reasons I've stated, this was that rare case. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.google.com/search?q=stack%20overflow%20unwelcoming" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

When that happens, the features or strong points named help show why that was a good choice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Example: &quot;rim brakes don't work well:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Product rec answer &quot;fit koolstop brake pads&quot;&#xD;&#xA;* Long-term useful answer &quot;replace the brake pads. Old pads go hard and don't work good.  Newer pads are softer and the more-modern materials grip better.  Some designs of shoe take physically longer pads too providing more contact area.  A good example is koolstop aftermarket pads.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically, its hard to avoid the well-thought-of brands/models like gp5000, marathons, koolstop, etc.  But making them a supporting piece of information is useful, while not being the main point in the answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, the better answers say &quot;**why**&quot; not just &quot;**what**&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;--------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Re-reading the example, I realise that the first part effectively cuts off any chain of discussion around which is the best item.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Otherwise it can turn into a forum-esque chain of replies like &quot;X is better than Y&quot;  &quot;No you're wrong Z is best&quot;   etc." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

In general, we ask for clear photographs of the entire bike, and preferably some close ups of select parts as well. Be aware that these are usually necessary *but not sufficient* to ID a manufacturer, model, and year. Identifying a manufacturer is easier, identifying model and year is harder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bicycle companies typically rely on decals, usually on the down tube at minimum, and head tube badges for branding. If you have those in the photo, you usually know who the bicycle *manufacturer* is. Of course, if those items are present, then the OP usually has the information to identify the manufacturer already. Nevertheless, not all head badges state the manufacturer clearly, but they can be recognized by enthusiasts. One example is Giant Bicycles' head tube badge. Naturally, some bicycles have had their decals and/or head badges removed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Failing that, with steel bikes, the design of the frame lugs and fork crown lugs can sometimes be informative, although not all frames use lugged construction. Some other design elements on bikes in general can be distinctive, which is why Criggie mentioned things like unusual-looking dropouts, sometimes the seat cluster. As another example, some Colnago steel bicycles (e.g. Master and Master X-Lite) used star-shaped down tubes on the argument that they had higher torsional rigidity, and I don't believe anyone else used these. I think that these unusual design elements are more rare, however.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Identifying the *model* and manufacturing *year* of the bicycle can be harder. Sometimes, enthusiasts can match a paint scheme to a catalog, thus providing model and year - if someone posted a scanned catalog online, or if they collect catalogs, or if there's an example of the bike online, e.g. on Bicycle Blue Book (but that tends to cover more modern bikes). We can make guesses if we recognize the components or other frame features. For example, in the first photo Criggie posted, the components look like 9-speed Shimano 105, which was current in the early 2000s. The bike has a quill stem, rather than a threadless headset and stem, and these were less common on early 2000s bikes. So, it's possible the bike is from around the early 2000s, but it's also possible the components were refitted and the bike was from the 1990s.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's been stated elsewhere, but the serial number is usually not helpful at all. Presenting the serial number alone is worthless, and it is quite possible that the question will get downvoted and maybe closed." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

[Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user)&#xA;&#xA;⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.&#xA;&#xA;⁵ Includes close flags (but *not* close or reopen votes).&#xA;&#xA;⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&#xA;&#xA;⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).   &#xA;   &#xA;### Further reading:&#xA;&#xA;- Wanna see how these numbers have changed over time?

To me, it means a bike with similar geometry to an endurance road bike but with wide tire clearance, probably up to 40mm if it’s a 2020 or later model year, possibly 35-38mm in earlier years. I think it is a subclass of gravel bike, although some might interpret as sitting somewhere between endurance road and gravel bikes. I am not sure if Jan Heine was the first user of the term, but I know I first encountered the phrase on his blog at Compass Cycles, and I am pretty sure it was a rare term until about 2020 or 2021. Another phrase is the term “integrated cockpit” for handlebar/stem combinations with fully hidden hoses and wiring; I know for a fact that some forum mates find this phrase very annoying."

My view is that the user has learned what works for them in cycling, but consistently translates this narrow view into a universal advice. The trope being, 36 spoke wheels, which we would all agree are strong and suitable for some applications, but that doesn't make them the only one applicable to all situations. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This lack of discernment brings conflict with the lived-experience of other site users. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They plainly don't let any amount of downvotes discourage them from posting - which you kind of have to admire - so I don't see the situation changing any time soon.

It's not like there's any suggestion of abusing the privileges earned by reputation, otherwise there would be a different discussion. I get the frustration though. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But to answer the question, I think the answer is voting and not being reluctant to use the downvote button. There are two buttons, one should be used when the 'answer is useful' and the other when the 'answer is not useful'. An answer can only be one of those two options, so we should pick one! We should review each question and answer and give a vote accordingly. Answers which we disagree with don't need flagging, only spam etc. does.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Downvoting maintains the 'credibility' of the system, so that our reputation is not the only factor giving authority to an answer. If our user has a high rep and the answer given gets a high score, then the reader is reassured. The small amount of reputation lost when downvoting isn't that meaningful in the long run. My 241 downvotes so far means 241 rep lost, not that huge. Then I get it back if the answer is deleted anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I will downvote an answer if I think its inaccuracies make the answer not useful. Or if the narrow viewpoint is restrictive to a fault. I will also downvote if an answer is written in a way which I think doesn't _actually_ answer the question. Those are not useful to the OP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said though, I don't often add a comment explaining my downvote. Perhaps I should be braver in my convictions and offer reasoning. It might help readers discern what information I think is misleading in the answer. It needs to be constructive and respectful though and that's another skill in itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Step 1, consistent voting. Step 2, comments when appropriate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The exact percentage doesn't matter as much as the contentions that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. The world isn't always black and white. It can help to think of things in shades of grey.&#xD;&#xA; 2. I think that kick scooters aren't clearly on-topic for Bicycles SE. The FAQ does limit it to wheeled vehicles that are exclusively or mainly pedal-powered.&#xD;&#xA; 3. However, kick scooters share some similarity with bicycles. They are human-powered. They move at similar speeds. The motor skills required to operate them have some similarities with bikes. There may be some crossover in components and equipment, e.g. bearings, cargo equipment.&#xD;&#xA; 4. I bet most people would consider balance bikes to be on topic. These are learning tools for children. Kick scooters are more similar to balance bikes than they are to standard bicycles. It is obviously possible to go too far with analogies, so you need some sort of limiting principle eventually.&#xD;&#xA; 5. Kick scooters may be in a grey area between bicycles and not-bicycles. I think I would be fine admitting them despite them not being as much like bicycles as unicycles, handcycles, balance bikes, etc.&#xD;&#xA; 6. Point 5 may change with circumstances, e.g. if kick scooters really take off in popularity and we get flooded with enough questions that people start wondering if they deserve their own SE site."

[Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user)&#xA;&#xA;⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.&#xA;&#xA;⁵ Includes close flags (but *not* close or reopen votes). Community can handle these flags by at least one person voting to close a question that has a close flag.&#xA;&#xA;⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&#xA;&#xA;⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).   &#xA;   &#xA;### Further reading:&#xA;&#xA;- Wanna see how these numbers have changed over time?

Is it Chat GPT?  That I am not sure of, but I do agree with Vladimir's intuition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With Chat GPT's new presence in our world, Google has pushed forward hard to release its own AI answer bot, so this is only going to get worse.

You could play to your strengths, looking for places where you personally have a skillset that is especially applicable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another approach is to focus on the most recent privilege that you've been granted as you gain more reputation. For example, your highest privilege (1000 reputation) at the time of this writing is that you can see vote counts. Pay attention to vote counts. Get a feel for what the community votes up, what they vote down, and what posts get both up and down votes. When you hit 2000 reputation, you'll be able to edit posts. Focus on improving posts through edits. Once you hit 3000 reputation, start paying attention to when you think something should be closed or reopened. And so on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the end, anything you do to improve the site will be appreciated.

I'll let them do so for themselves, if they choose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Speaking for myself, I have been on the fence regarding the strike. I understand the issues that the moderation community is raising and agree that they need to be addressed. I feel that I should support the strike. However, in balancing that action with the size of our site, where we don't have a zillion high-rep users who can keep the site chugging along, I'm not sure that going mod-free won't do more harm to _our_ community than good. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We've already seen at least one user who has tried to take advantage of the strike to post hate speech. Because our mods have not joined the strike yet, action was quickly taken. Had our mods been on strike, the action taken would have been less severe and may not have taken place at all. This, no doubt, would have been harmful to our community. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, I'm not sure that an AI Content Policy is a hill worth dying on. While AI generated content definitely has the potential to create havoc on our site, we haven't seen a _ton_ of it so far. I'm also not sure that any policy created around AI content at this particular moment in history should be viewed as the permanent, end-all be-all policy. Rather, as AI evolves, I expect our policies to evolve. We'll get it wrong sometimes. We'll get it right sometimes. And when I say &quot;we&quot; here, I mean both _our_ community and the larger Stack Exchange network. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, the issues raised in the strike are real. The way the policy was rolled out was definitively anti-community and anti-consensus driven. I am somewhat prevented from revealing details due to the agreement I signed when becoming a moderator, but I am comfortable saying that I don't disagree with any of the stated positions of the group on strike. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For now, I'm going to sit and wait. I'm going to watch the talks unfold. And, most importantly, I'm going to listen to the feedback from _this_ community. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll update this answer if my position changes.

I interact with those communities in different ways.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've also been involved as a mod since this site was an Area51 proposal, and was a very early Stack Overflow member as well. So I have seen community and moderator controversies come and go. The sites certainly have changed over time, but there has not yet been anything that has risen to a level that I would want to completely walk away from the Bicycle.SE group.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I agree with the strikers that policy changes and their roll-out have been capricious in the past, and that it feels like the voices of experienced moderators have been discounted if not ignored.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the same time I share the concerns over automated detection tools. I have tested several using text that I wrote on both technical and general blogs over the years, and multiple passages have been flagged as having &quot;a moderate likelihood of being written by AI&quot;, and some a high likelihood. Automated tools will improve I am sure, but the inaccuracy and bias concerns me.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I feel the risk of this site being overrun by trolls posting unchecked abuse, hate, racism and other distasteful content is worth my continuing to check in as a moderator as my time allows.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm grateful for the active moderation effort of jimchristie and criggie, as well those of past moderators and high rep users who keep this site running (for the most part) cleanly and effectively."

I suggest migrating it to Sports.SE to see if it does better there, with the realisation that it is now an additional two weeks removed from the event.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What do you think?

(emphasis&#xD;&#xA;&gt; added)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Racing definitely qualifies as use of a bicycle. While questions about observations in professional races may seem esoteric, they can have practical applications for amateur racers. Many riders on this site have likely participated in races, and some may even participate in amateur stage races. Furthermore, all professionals start out as amateurs and, as such, future pros might glean some knowledge about racing from this site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as whether or not to migrate that specific post, I suggest that we leave it up to the OP. It may do better on Sports SE. It may not. Based on the [cycling questions][2] I see there and the _very_ limited number of [cycling strategy][3] questions, I suspect the latter. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since it's not off topic, it should be up to the OP where it lives. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://sports.stackexchange.com/search?q=cycling&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://sports.stackexchange.com/search?q=cycling%20strategy" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I wanted this community to know that while the strike hasn't officially been called off, it appears to be winding down. Many moderators have resumed moderating duties and the automated moderation tools that are maintained by the community are being reactivated. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stack Exchange has released a new set of AI Content Moderation guidelines. As before, I can't reveal the details of the policy. This was at the request of the moderators' community and not a directive of Stack Exchange. However, the new policy has been well received by the moderators' community. In my personal opinion, it's commonsense and largely reflects what the moderators on this site had been doing anyway. If you see something that you suspect is AI generated, please flag it. The mods will handle it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can't speak to the other issues that the striking moderators had raised. As mentioned before, [I didn't participate in the strike][2] and wasn't involved in any of the discussions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've shared this in the spirit of open communication, not because I expect anyone to take any action based on this post. I simply didn't want to leave the community in the dark regarding major developments with the strike. If the strike continues to wind down, as I expect it will, I won't share anything further. If something unexpected happens, I will. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask them.
